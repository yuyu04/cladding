// Cladding · README record-honesty pins (F-3c2bf8b9)
//

// is a drift-detection tool, so its own front-page honesty claims must not
// drift. Continuation of the 0.6.x "Honest release" series — a 2026-07-04
// audit found the who/what/why record claim overclaimed on durability and on
// who/when, so these tests pin all four README variants at the VERIFIED level
// (what verified → committed content, who/when → local session ledger, why →
// spec) and sweep out the audit-/regulation-grade overclaims that were cut.
// The who-ledger deferral (shipped as a backlog note, not code) is pinned too.
//
// These are cladding-SELF pins (they read this repo's own files), NOT shipped
// detectors — an adopting project may word its own README however it likes.
