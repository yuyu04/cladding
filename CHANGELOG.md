Versioning: [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-11 — Structural Harness

**In one line:** governance stops being a request — hooks enforce it, a committed
attestation stamps what was actually verified, the spec finally renders into
human-readable documents, and the oracle policy controls its own cost.

### Added

- **Host hooks (Claude Code)** — the plugin ships five lifecycle hooks:
  every session starts with the spec map injected; editing `status: done` into
  a shard by hand is *blocked* (run `clad done` — it's earned, not written);
  ending a session on fresh gate failures is blocked once (an identical,
  unfixable failure lets you leave and resurfaces next session); drift nudges
  after edits; natural prompts get a one-line routing suggestion.
- **Verification attestation** — a GREEN strict `pre-push` gate writes
  `spec/attestation.yaml` (a content hash per done feature, committed). The
  new `STALE_ATTESTATION` detector (#36) flags shipped code that changed since
  its last verified state — on fresh clones, in CI, and across squash/rebase.
- **Strict skip-policy demand table** — under `--strict`, a skipped stage the
  spec relies on is RED: declared language + done features demand the type
  check; declared tests demand the runner; declared oracles demand the
  conformance stage; a declared-safe deliverable demands the smoke. No demand →
  skips stay green (no new false REDs).
- **test_ref self-healing** — `clad sync` repairs refs whose files moved
  (unique-basename match, anchor preserved) and suggests `derived:` candidates
  for unannotated done ACs. Suggestions never satisfy the gate — only removing
  the prefix (author confirmation) makes them count.
- **`clad changelog`** — the spec renders into documents: capability-grouped
  release notes, `--audit` (every AC with its verification refs marked
  resolved/missing), `--catalog` (the whole spec in plain sentences). MCP tool
  `clad_changelog` + a skill that renders EN+KO in this file's house style.
- **`clad context` / `clad_get_context`** — the working set for one feature in
  one call (focus + ancestors + scenarios + ai_hints + test_refs). Look up by
  id, slug, or module path.
- **`clad_run_gate`** — run the real gate pipeline from inside a session
  (the MCP surface could previously only run drift). Mutating MCP tools now
  return the gate state as a JSON field, and payloads carry `schema_version`.
- **blind-author agent** — test/oracle authoring with *no read tools at all*:
  "authored impl-blind" becomes a property of the toolset, not a promise.
- **Oracle policy that binds behavior** — grown projects (≥8 done features)
  get a report-only risk-weighted mandate (`unwanted` ACs; enforcement in
  0.7) whose report names the EARS-untagged blind spot; out-of-policy
  `clad_author_oracle` recordings are labeled `voluntary` with a cost note;
  guidance keys authoring to `clad oracle --required`.
- **Lifecycle ledger** — feature creation, every `done` attempt (kept or
  reverted), and every gate run land in `.cladding/events.log.jsonl` with the
  actor identity and git HEAD; logs rotate at 5 MB.
- **`spec/index.yaml`** — one generated line per feature: lookup is a 1-file
  grep at any scale (with `merge=union` friendliness and an INVENTORY_DRIFT
  staleness check).
- **Enforcement triggers** — `clad init --with-hook` installs pre-commit AND
  pre-push hooks; `clad init --with-ci` scaffolds the authoritative CI gate
  (`fetch-depth: 0`; client hooks are latency reducers, CI is where
  enforcement is real).
- **Terminology SSoT** — `docs/glossary.md` (EN + KO) locked by the test
  suite; new feature ids are 8-hex (birthday-safe at thousands of shards).
- **Ops visibility polish (F-95a096)** — a completion-claim utterance
  ("looks done, wrap it up", "마무리") gets a dedicated earn-path card naming
  `clad done` (the weakest measured engagement surface in the 0.6.0 A/B);
  `clad doctor` summarizes the governance ledger (gate runs + last outcome,
  done attempts/rejections, stop blocks, attestation entries) in text and
  `--json`; `clad status` gains an `att` column — attestation freshness per
  feature (✓ current / ! stale-or-unstamped / · n/a / - no attestation yet).

### Changed

- Renames with one-release aliases (removal in 0.7): `librarian` → `planner`,
  `specialists` → `developer`, `refine` → `clarify`, `panel` → `status`,
  `drive` → `run`. The never-implemented `work` stub is removed.
- SDK model defaults move to the current generation with a 16k output
  ceiling; pin per-project via `.cladding/config.yaml` `agent.model`.
- A drift pass loads the spec once instead of once per detector — a
  5,000-shard gate runs in ~1.4 s (machine-enforced budget).

### Fixed (found by installing 0.6.0 like a real user)

- `clad sync`'s test_ref repair corrupted paths under the real invocation
  (`cwd='.'`) and looped on its own output — fixed with regression tests that
  run exactly the real way.
- The gate no longer auto-installs npm packages: bare `npx tsc` on a
  toolchain-less machine fetched and executed the typosquat `tsc@2.0.4`.
  All toolchain calls are `npx --no-install`; an absent tool is an honest
  skip the demand table escalates.
- `clad serve`'s banner moved off stdout (the MCP wire) to stderr.

### Deprecated

- `ai_hints.token_budget_per_session` (never had a runtime consumer) — still
  accepted, no longer written; removal in 0.7.

### Verified

- Real-user battery 31/31 on a tarball install; three-arm hard-task build
  measured (the full report: `docs/benchmarks/v0.6.0-real-user-verification.md`)
  — hooks halve the cost of running cladding and produced the only
  defect-free arm; honest readings included (greenfield conformance remains
  tied with vanilla; the premium buys traceability and enforcement).

## [0.5.2] — 2026-06-08 — Fixes from installing 0.5.1 like a real user

**In one line:** we installed 0.5.1 the way a new user does — from npm, then through the marketplace
plugin — and fixed the rough edges that surfaced. The Claude Code plugin now works on its own without a
separate global install, a green gate no longer hides "your tests never actually ran," and several error
messages now tell you what to do instead of leaving you to guess. Nothing here changes a green build that was
already honest; it closes the gaps where green wasn't.

### Added

- **The gate now runs your project's actual entry point.** A new check (`Deliverable smoke`) executes the
  deliverable you declare in `spec.yaml` (e.g. `./run`, your CLI) once a feature is done, and fails if it
  crashes — catching the case where the code's own unit tests pass but the *shipped entry point* is broken
  (because the tests exercise internals and never invoke the entry). It runs only an entry you explicitly mark
  `is_safe_to_smoke: true`, with a timeout, and never on every commit — so it never auto-runs arbitrary code. A
  companion detector warns when a finished feature ships code but declares no deliverable to smoke-test. It
  costs nothing extra (no AI involved) — a cheap floor under the opt-in spec-conformance oracle, which still
  owns the harder "runs but produces the wrong answer."

### Fixed

- **The Claude Code marketplace plugin now works on its own.** Installing just the plugin used to leave its
  MCP server dead unless you had *also* run `npm install -g cladding` — the server shelled out to a global
  `clad` that wasn't there. The plugin now ships the engine inside itself and launches it directly, so it
  works with nothing else installed. (Codex and Gemini still use the global `clad`; the README now says so
  plainly.)
- **A green gate can no longer hide "the tests never ran."** If the test runner wasn't installed, the gate
  treated the skipped test step as a pass — so a feature marked *done* could be entirely unverified and still
  go green. Under `--strict`, a *done* feature whose tests did not run now fails, with a message telling you
  to install the test framework.
- **A missing scanner is a setup gap, not a fake "secret found."** When the secret or architecture scanner
  could not run (no config on a fresh project), the gate reported it as if it had *found* a violation. It now
  correctly says it "couldn't scan" instead of raising a false alarm — and a scanner that genuinely finds
  something still fails the gate.
- **Agent personas load on a real install.** The five personas (orchestrator, librarian, reviewer,
  observability, specialists) failed to resolve when cladding ran from an npm install rather than the source
  tree; they are now shipped next to the engine and found in every run mode.
- **Clearer `test_ref` errors.** A test reference that points at a specific test inside a file
  (`tests/x.test.ts#parses a tag`) now resolves correctly, and when a reference really is broken the message
  lists the forms it accepts instead of only saying it "resolves to nothing."

### Changed

- **`clad drive` is marked experimental and now fails honestly.** The headless autonomous loop needs an LLM
  transport that is not built yet, and nothing auto-invokes it — the supported path is host-delegated (your
  AI tool drives the per-feature cadence). A run that produces only empty stubs now says so and exits non-zero
  instead of reporting "all work complete," and `clad rollback` makes clear that it prints the git command for
  you to run rather than executing it itself.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-05 — A gate that can catch a hidden bug

**In one line:** until now, `clad check` went green whenever *your code's own tests* passed — even if the
code didn't actually do what the spec asked. 0.5.1 lets the gate run a second, independent check, written
from the spec *without looking at the code*, so a green gate can finally mean "this matches the spec," not
just "the author's own tests passed." It also fixes a harmless-but-alarming error that showed up in *every*
project, and makes writing specs a little less fiddly. **Everything new here is opt-in** — upgrading changes
nothing until you turn it on.

### Added

- **An independent "did it really match the spec?" check (opt-in).** The gate can now run a spec-derived
  test suite that was written without seeing the implementation, and check the code against the *spec*
  rather than against the author's own assumptions — so a hidden mismatch the author's tests missed turns
  the gate red. Turn it on per project with `oracle_policy` (off by default). New pieces:
  `clad oracle` (get the spec-only brief), `clad_author_oracle` (record the result), the `SPEC_CONFORMANCE`
  gate check, and a 34th drift detector.
- **Spec mistakes are caught the moment you write them.** Creating a feature now rejects a malformed
  acceptance criterion right away, instead of letting you find out later when the gate fails.
- **`clad check --json`** — machine-readable gate results with the exact file, line, and suggested fix for
  each finding (no more squinting at truncated text).
- **A place to write down *why* a decision was made.** Record the reasoning behind a non-obvious choice in
  an acceptance criterion's `notes` (`## Decision` / `## Why` / `## Trade-off`), so a future reader doesn't
  "fix" it the wrong way. Optional — see `docs/ssot-model.md`.

### Changed

- **Less noise, cheaper turns.** The in-session check returns a short summary by default (full detail on
  request), the spec context is cached between steps, and the heavy gate runs once per feature (at
  `clad done`) instead of repeatedly.
- **You rarely need to run `clad sync` by hand anymore** — creating a feature keeps the inventory current,
  and `check` / `done` validate on their own.

### Fixed

- **No more false "schema.json not found" error.** Every project was hitting a spurious error about a
  missing internal file; the gate now simply skips it when absent (it was never actually required).
- **A broken spec file can no longer slip through green.** A malformed spec shard used to pass the gate
  silently — it now correctly fails.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-01 — No Vacuous Green: honest gates, the per-feature cadence, and an enforced SSoT

**The theme: a gate that passes must mean the work was actually verified.** This release closes a
family of "Vacuous Green" holes — places where `clad check` went green without checking anything —
and turns the 4-tier SSoT from an advisory model into an enforced one. It also reshapes development
around a per-feature cadence (spec → code → test → gated done → next) and gives the design tier a
real authoring path. The drift-detector set grows **28 → 33**.

### Added

- **`clad done <featureId>`** — the honest-done floor. `status: done` was just the host writing YAML,
  so a feature could be "done" while the strict gate was red. `clad done` flips the shard, runs
  `clad check --tier=pre-push --strict` with the feature evaluated as done (flip-then-gate, so the
  done-aware detectors apply), and keeps `done` only if GREEN — reverting otherwise. `runCheckCommand`
  was split into a shared `runCheckStages`, so the done gate is provably the check gate.
- **`clad update`** — the one-command post-upgrade reconciliation (15th CLI verb). After
  `npm update -g cladding`, run it from inside a project: it re-wires hosts, refreshes the
  `inventory:` snapshot, refreshes the cladding-managed `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` section
  (staleness-based, your own prose preserved — never `--force`, never an LLM), then **reports —
  without blocking or editing your spec — what the now-stricter detectors flag**, so a stricter
  release can't quietly fail an unchanged project. It reconciles only the current directory (cd in
  per project) and never self-updates the engine — `npm update -g cladding` is the user's step.
- **`clad_link_capability`** (MCP tool #7) — the deterministic Tier-B firing path. A capability is
  *accumulative*, so the verb is `link` (upsert a feature into a capability, creating it if absent),
  not `create`. Establishes the authoring verb taxonomy: **create** an entity (feature/scenario) ·
  **link** a relationship (capability) · **refine** a document (architecture/project-context).
- **Tier-B `capabilities` in the schema + typed `Spec`** — `spec/capabilities.yaml` is now merged
  into the loaded Spec and JSON-Schema-validated at parse time (a malformed capability fails
  `loadSpec`), instead of being read ad-hoc by one soft detector.
- **5 new drift detectors** — `PLANNED_BACKLOG` (#29, too many code-less planned features = the spec
  racing ahead of the code), `HOLLOW_GOVERNANCE` (#30, a grown project with an empty
  `capabilities`/`architecture` design tier), `DEPENDENCY_CYCLE` (#31, a circular `depends_on` graph
  that silently deadlocks the drive loop), `SCENARIO_COVERAGE` (#32, a grown project with no scenarios
  / a hollow scenario / an under-bound scenario whose flow names a feature it never binds),
  `PROJECT_CONTEXT_DRIFT` (#33, a `project-context.md` still on the unrefined init template).
- **The per-feature cadence as the cycle** — `docs/feature-cycle.md` (the orchestrator's per-feature
  loop, mode-adaptive across conversational / single-feature / `/goal` / headless), the
  "Feature cycle — one at a time" rule in the always-loaded CLAUDE.md + AGENTS templates, and the
  orchestrator persona's mode gloss.
- **`docs/ssot-audit.md`** — the recorded SSoT document-system audit (necessity / structure / firing /
  enforcement) and its fix roadmap. Hash-model **acceptance-criterion ids** (`AC-<hash6>`) for
  multi-dev merge safety, matching the feature/scenario hash model.

### Changed

- **`clad_create_feature` / `clad_create_scenario`** author rich shards (acceptance_criteria, modules,
  flow) instead of empty stubs, and auto-sync the `inventory:` block on every create.
- **Greenfield init seeds a high-quality baseline** — documented `docBlockRatio`, module purpose
  headers, a "Why > What" conventions section, and a lean-core architecture note (greenfield only;
  existing projects keep their observed conventions).
- **`INVENTORY_DRIFT`** now also warns when the `inventory:` block is *absent* on a project with shards
  (previously a free pass), closing the hollow-spec loophole from the absent side.
- **`docs/ssot-model.md`** reconciled with code — dropped the false "`clad_create_feature` binds
  scenarios" claim, documented the create/link/refine verb taxonomy, and moved the now-built detectors
  from deferred to enforced.
- **Anti-self-cert is now stated honestly** across the personas, `docs/feature-cycle.md`, and spec
  AC-003. The *enforced* identity layer (`checkAc` requires human evidence before stage_4; the drive
  loop halts when reviewer identity equals the implementer's) is split from the *advisory* blindness
  (a test-author not reading the implementation), which no gate enforces — an A/B run found
  test-authors reading impl files in 4/4 features despite the instruction. The test-author dispatch is
  now handed the acceptance criteria **+ module signatures only** (interface-stub, removing the reason
  to peek), the reviewer explicitly owns auditing the blindness, and the overclaim
  "anti-self-cert is structural, not a name check" is dropped.

### Fixed (Vacuous Green closures)

- A stage that RAN and failed can no longer pass as a "skip" (exit-2 vs exit-1 discipline).
- Missing secret/architecture scanners now skip honestly (info), never false-report green.
- A hollow `done` feature (no modules, no acceptance criteria) fails the gate (`STATUS_DRIFT`).
- A present-but-broken `spec.yaml` fails `ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE` instead of slipping through.
- The two-layer design-tier Vacuous Green (empty seeds passing existence + empty-content checks) is
  closed by `HOLLOW_GOVERNANCE`.

### Fixed (cross-platform & release hygiene)

- **Windows: `clad` no longer crashes on every command.** `bin/clad` imported the dist bundle via a
  raw absolute path, which the ESM loader rejects on Windows as URL scheme `c:`
  (`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`); it now resolves through `pathToFileURL`. Companion hardening:
  host-setup activation spawns run through a shell on Windows (`.cmd` shims), the `inventory:` rewrite
  is CRLF-safe, and `clad init --scan` layer inference splits on `/` rather than the platform
  separator. CI is POSIX, so a source-level regression guard pins the `pathToFileURL` shape.
- **The marketplace catalog can no longer ship a stale version.** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  (the version the Claude Code host reads to detect "update available") was neither a `version-bump`
  site nor a `HARNESS_INTEGRITY` check, so it lagged silently while the gate stayed green. It is now
  the 9th version-bump site and a dedicated `HARNESS_INTEGRITY` branch — a half-bumped catalog fails
  the gate.
- **The release ritual now reaches existing users.** `npm publish` is a documented release step (the
  engine runs from the global `clad`, so a tag + GitHub release alone never reached npm users), guarded
  by `prepublishOnly: npm run build` so a publish can't ship a stale `dist/` or stale plugin mirrors.

### Why v0.5.0 (minor bump)

Substantial additive, backward-compatible surface: two new CLI verbs (`clad done`, `clad update`), a
new MCP tool (`clad_link_capability`), 5 new detectors, capabilities in the schema, and hash-model AC
ids (the schema accepts both legacy `AC-NNN` and the new hash). Existing specs, shards, and gates keep
working; the new signals are `warn`-by-default (blocking only under `--strict`). No breaking changes.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-27 — `clad setup` command — split npm install from host wire (F-80d19d)

**Reverting F-90d054's npm `postinstall` side effect.** v0.3.60 made `npm install -g cladding` automatically wire four host AI channels in `$HOME` (`~/.claude/`, `~/.gemini/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.agents/`). The convenience was real — npm-path users got `/cladding init` for free — but the cost was steep: every npm install touched four global directories whether or not the user had those AI tools, CI sandboxes needed `CLADDING_SKIP_POSTINSTALL=1`, and `clad init` carried a fallback retry path. v0.4.0 splits the responsibility: install is install, wire is wire.

### Added

- **New command `clad setup`** — explicit host channel wirer. One command handles six scenarios in a single run:
  - **first wire** — create symlinks for detected hosts
  - **update** — re-wire if the existing symlink target is a different cladding root (e.g. after `nvm` switch or manifest schema change)
  - **delta** — wire only the newly detected host when a user installs a new AI tool between runs
  - **repair** — re-create symlinks deleted by the user or reset by the host AI
  - **no-op** — print "already wired" without filesystem changes when everything matches
  - **conflict** — refuse to overwrite directory-copy wires (Windows fallback) with custom changes unless `--force` is supplied
- **`src/init/host-setup.ts`** — TypeScript implementation of the wirer, replacing the `scripts/postinstall.mjs` JavaScript hook. Detects each host via its home directory (`~/.claude/`, `~/.gemini/`, `~/.codex/`, `~/.agents/`); undetected hosts are skipped (no surprise `$HOME` directories).
- **`~/.cladding/setup-status.json`** — records the last `cladding_version`, wiring report, and errors. `clad init` reads it to detect version skew.
- **Friendly stdout** — `clad setup` always ends with a numbered "다음 단계" block (1. open AI tool → 2. cd to project → 3. `/cladding init "..."` → 4. start coding).
- **`spec/features/setup-command-80d19d.yaml`** (F-80d19d) — 10 acceptance criteria covering install / update / delta / repair / no-op / conflict / not-installed-skip / init-skew-warning / npm-install-no-side-effect / next-step-guidance.
- **`tests/cli/setup.test.ts`** — 10 unit tests, one per AC, exercising the wirer against a mocked `$HOME`.

### Changed

- **`clad init`** — removed the F-90d054 postinstall-fallback retry path. `clad init` now never wires host channels on its own. If no `setup-status.json` exists, it appends a friendly skipped notice ("host channels not wired yet — run `clad setup`") and continues with spec generation. If the binary version differs from the recorded setup version, it appends a softer notice ("symlinks usually auto-follow, but run `clad setup` to be sure"). Neither blocks spec creation.
- **`src/cli/clad.ts`** — registers `.command('setup')` with `--force` and `--quiet` flags.

### Removed

- **`scripts/postinstall.mjs`** — deleted. The npm `postinstall` lifecycle hook is no longer registered in `package.json`. `npm install -g cladding` now produces zero filesystem side effects in `$HOME`.
- **`src/init/postinstall-fallback.ts`** — deleted. The retry path inside `clad init` is gone with it.
- **`package.json` `"postinstall"` script** — removed from `scripts`. **`scripts/postinstall.mjs`** also removed from the `files[]` publish list.

### Why v0.4.0 (minor bump)

Behavioral change for npm-path users (one extra `clad setup` command between install and init). Backward-safe in practice — existing v0.3.60 wires (symlinks/config.toml entries) survive the upgrade unchanged. Marketplace-path users are unaffected (the marketplace manifest still handles wiring on install).

### Migration

- **Upgrading from v0.3.60** — `npm install -g cladding@0.4.0`. Symlinks created by v0.3.60's postinstall already point at the cladding package root, so they auto-follow the upgrade with no action. Re-run `clad setup` only if you switched node managers (nvm) or moved your home directory.
- **Fresh install** — `npm install -g cladding && clad setup && clad init "..."`.
- **Marketplace** — unchanged. `/cladding init "..."` works as before.

### Auto-activation — 5-host plugin install runs automatically

`clad setup` does not stop at symlinks. After wiring each detected host channel, it auto-invokes the host's plugin activation command (non-interactive, 30s timeout each):

- **Claude Code** — `claude plugin marketplace add ~/.claude/plugins/cladding --scope user` + `claude plugin install claude-code@cladding --scope user`
- **Gemini CLI** — `gemini extensions link ~/.gemini/extensions/cladding` (skipped if `gemini extensions list` already shows cladding)
- **Codex CLI skills** — auto-detected from `~/.agents/skills/` on Codex restart (no command needed)
- **Codex MCP** — the TOML entry itself is the registration (no command needed)
- **Cursor** — the `~/.cursor/mcp.json` entry itself is the registration (no command needed)

Each channel's `↳ 활성화:` line in stdout reports `✓ 자동 완료` or `✗ 자동 시도 실패 — 수동:` followed by the fallback command. If `claude` or `gemini` binary isn't on PATH, the manual command is shown instead. Existing v0.3.60 wires are preserved.

### Fixed — plugin manifest now declares the MCP server (ISSUE-002, packaging gap)

`plugins/claude-code/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` now carries an `mcpServers` field. Prior v0.4.x packages shipped the plugin's commands and agents but *not* the MCP server declaration — so consumer projects (any project outside cladding's own repo) opened Claude Code with the cladding plugin loaded but the `clad_create_feature` / `clad_list_features` / `clad_run_check` / `clad_get_events` / `clad_create_scenario` tools missing. AGENTS.md's "use `clad_create_feature` MCP tool" guidance was therefore impossible to follow, which contributed to spec drift in adopting projects (see logcat-on `docs/cladding-issues.md` ISSUE-001).

With the fix, enabling the cladding plugin (`claude plugin install claude-code@cladding`) auto-starts cladding's MCP server in every project — same model as Codex's `~/.codex/config.toml` wire. No `claude mcp add` user action; no manual server-connect step. The server appears in trust scope of the plugin (it does **not** surface in `claude mcp list` — that listing only shows user-added MCP servers, not plugin-declared ones).

Repo root `.mcp.json` was removed at the same time — it was a v0.3.x leftover from when the plugin lived at the repo root, and after Layer 1 it would just duplicate the canonical declaration in the plugin manifest.

The README's MCP narrative was corrected accordingly: every host gets cladding as an MCP server (only the wire *location* differs between plugin manifest, Codex's TOML, and Cursor's JSON); the v0.4.0 line claiming "Claude Code and Gemini CLI ... don't need MCP wired" was rationalizing a packaging bug as design intent.

**Migration for existing v0.4.0 users**: run `clad setup --force` (or `claude plugin install claude-code@cladding --force --scope user`) to refresh the plugin cache, then restart Claude Code. The MCP tools should appear in the AI's tool list inside any project where the plugin is enabled.

### Fixed — four findings surfaced by end-to-end verification

A multi-host verification pass (Claude Code + Gemini CLI driving `/cladding:init` across bare / intent / path-intent / existing-adoption scenarios, plus a dev cycle of hand-authored hash-based feature → `clad sync` → `clad check` → drift inject) surfaced four issues that v0.4.0 now resolves:

- **F1 (high) — `spec/architecture.yaml` seed emitted `version: "0.1"` which `clad sync` rejected.** The architecture schema (`src/spec/schema.json::definitions.architecture`) declares `additionalProperties: false` with only `layers` + `forbidden_imports` allowed, so the seed contradicted the schema and made cladding's own dogfood fail validation. Removed `version: "0.1"` from `renderGreenfieldArchitectureYaml`, from the LLM-rendered observed-scan architecture (`src/cli/scan/llm.ts`), and from both LLM prompt templates (`src/cli/scan/llm.ts` + `src/cli/scan/intent-onboarding.ts`). Added a defensive `stripArchVersionKey` helper applied to LLM-emitted architecture bodies in `interpretOnboardingWithFallback` + `applyRefineDelta` so models trained on the older shape don't reintroduce the broken key.
- **F2 (medium) — Gemini CLI's extension `GEMINI.md` did not surface the EARS feature-shard schema** loudly enough; the Gemini AI authored ACs with `description:` and got rejected by `clad sync` on its first pass. Added an "Authoring feature shards (read before writing one)" section to `plugins/gemini-cli/GEMINI.md` that lays out the canonical filename (`<slug>-<hash6>.yaml`), id (`F-<hash6>`), required body shape, EARS templates for each of the six AC kinds, and the explicit "do NOT use `description:`" callout.
- **F3 (low) — `gemini -p --yolo` still required `--skip-trust`** to run cladding from non-trusted directories (e.g. CI runners, `/tmp` workspaces). Documented the headless flag and the `GEMINI_CLI_TRUST_WORKSPACE=true` env-var alternative in `plugins/gemini-cli/GEMINI.md`.
- **F4 (low) — `clad check` printed only one-line pass/fail labels per stage**, hiding the *why* of every failure unless the user knew to invoke `clad doctor`. `runCheckCommand` now indents the first three error-severity drift findings (`[DETECTOR_NAME] path — message`) under each failed Drift stage, and the first line of stderr under each non-drift failed stage. A footer hint (`ℹ Run \`clad doctor\` for the event log, or \`clad sync\` to validate spec shards.`) appears whenever any stage fails. Output stays terse enough to scan, while the *cause* of each `✗` is now legible without follow-up commands.

Verification artifacts live at `/tmp/clad-verify/REPORT.md` (5/5 scenarios passing after the fixes). Test suite: 973/973.

### Docs — v0.4.0 consistency benchmark

A six-phase benchmark (`docs/benchmarks/v0.4.0-consistency-bench.md`) measured cladding-on vs cladding-off ("vibe coding") on a fixed HMAC-validation task: ~60% consistency improvement (Δ 443 → 176 lines on same-prompt repeats), ~52% LOC reduction, 100% intentional-drift detection in a 5-iteration dev cycle, and 71% trap detection across seven deliberate spec violations. The doc is candid about a confounding factor (the cladding-on prompt carries the AC text in-band, so part of the gain is the general "more-specific prompt" effect, not exclusively cladding's mechanism) and lists four areas where cladding *uniquely* contributes — persistence, automatic drift detection, multi-host parity, and audit trail. README × 4 link to it.

### Docs — MCP server's role clarified in README

A short blockquote next to the `clad setup` 5-host table now states explicitly that the MCP server is not user-facing — it is the plumbing channel through which Codex CLI and Cursor's AI register features (`clad_create_feature`), look up spec entries, and tail audit events in response to natural-language requests. Claude Code and Gemini CLI reach the same surface through plugin commands and extensions, so they don't need MCP wired. The user-facing surface is always `/cladding:init` plus normal chat. (Docs-only; no behavior change.)

### 5th host — Cursor

`clad setup` now detects `~/.cursor/` and writes `mcpServers.cladding = { command: "clad", args: ["serve"] }` into `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (JSON merge). Cursor picks up cladding as an MCP server on restart — no separate activation.

### `plugins/claude-code/` subdirectory — Claude marketplace fix

cladding's Claude Code plugin moved from the repo root (`agents/` + `commands/` + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) into `plugins/claude-code/` (parallel to existing `plugins/codex/` and `plugins/gemini-cli/`). The repo-root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now points `source: "./plugins/claude-code"`. Without this split, `claude plugin install` failed with *"source type your Claude Code version does not support"* because Claude Code's marketplace model requires the plugin source to be a subdirectory, not the marketplace root.

`plugin.json` schema fixes: `author` is now an object (`{name: ...}`), `repository` is a string URL.

### Removed — `spec.yaml._meta.enrichment_status` lazy marker (F-90d054)

F-80d19d's `clad setup` step now provisions every detected host as part of the explicit setup flow, so a host AI is always available when the user opens the project. The lazy-enrichment scaffold — which existed because v0.3.60's `npm install -g cladding` path could not summon an AI session at install time — is no longer needed.

- **Deleted**: `src/init/marker.ts`, `src/stages/detectors/enrichment-pending.ts`, `tests/init/marker.test.ts`, `tests/stages/enrichment-pending.test.ts`
- **Schema removal**: `spec.yaml._meta` block (`enrichment_status` / `enrichment_scope` / `detected` / `enriched_by` / `enriched_at`) removed from `src/spec/schema.json`. Existing specs that still carry `_meta` continue to validate because cladding ignores unknown top-level keys, but `clad init` no longer writes the block on fresh projects.
- **AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md templates**: the *first-task enrichment rule* section removed from `src/init/host-instructions.ts`
- **Detector count**: 28 → **27**. The `spec maintenance` category drops from 5 → 4 (removed `ENRICHMENT_PENDING`).
- **F-90d054 spec**: marked `status: archived` with a pointer to F-80d19d
- **Slash command surface**: Claude Code and Gemini CLI now expose only `/cladding:init` (legacy `/cladding:clad` wrapper and per-verb `.toml` shards removed). Other verbs are invoked by the AI via natural language → `clad <verb>` CLI; Codex skills retain all 12 verbs because Codex auto-invokes them without slash exposure.

### Removed — placeholder `spec/features/F-001-first.yaml` seed from `clad init`

`clad init` no longer writes a legacy-format `F-001-first.yaml` seed feature into external user projects. The seed previously emitted `id: F-001` + `slug: first-feature` — exactly the *F-NNN sequential format* cladding's own `CLAUDE.md` forbids for new spec entries (the hash-based `<slug>-<hash6>.yaml` model has been the standard since v0.3.9). External users now receive a clean `spec.yaml` with `features: []` and an empty `spec/features/` directory; the AI registers real features on demand via `clad_create_feature` (MCP) or the `clad` CLI, always using hash-based filenames + IDs. The historical `F-001` ~ `F-083` files inside cladding's own repo stay sequential — they're stable identifiers in audit logs and historical references (per the `CLAUDE.md` maintainer invariant).

- **Deleted**: `f001SeedShard()` function + its call site in `src/cli/init.ts`
- **Tests updated**: `tests/cli/init.test.ts` now asserts the F-001 placeholder is *not* created and `features: []` is present; `tests/scenarios/greenfield-lifecycle.test.ts` swaps the F-001 body assertion for a `docs/project-context.md` intent check
- **Docs**: `skills/init/SKILL.md` and `src/agents/orchestrator.md` no longer mention the F-001 placeholder; post-init guidance now points users at `clad_create_feature` / natural-language conversation
- **AB-evaluation metric**: cladding-group `Tier A artifacts` count drops from 4 → 3 (no more F-001 shard)

### Stale instruction-file auto refresh — `clad init`

`clad init` now detects v0.3.x markers in any existing project-local `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (`_meta.enrichment_status`, `first-task enrichment rule`, or a lone `clad_create_feature` MCP-tool wording with no `clad` CLI qualifier) and rewrites the file in place without requiring `--force`. AGENTS.md is replaced wholesale; CLAUDE.md replaces only the `## cladding` section so any user content outside the marker block survives. This closes the v0.3.60 → v0.4.0 migration gap where stale "use the MCP tool" guidance was triggering MCP-server prompts inside Claude Code (which does not get the cladding MCP server — only Codex / Cursor do).

Template wording was also softened: the AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md templates plus the `spec/scenarios/README.md` payload no longer mention `clad_create_feature` MCP tool as the only option — they reference the `clad` CLI first and condition the MCP-tool callout on hosts that wire cladding as an MCP server.

### Removed — `claude plugin install --scope project` inside `clad init`

The user-scope plugin install performed by `clad setup` is sufficient on every code path: marketplace users get plugin activation for free, npm users run `clad setup` once, and the cladding repo itself ships `.claude/settings.json` for maintainers. The redundant project-scope install inside `clad init` was triggering Claude Code permission/trust prompts every time a user ran `/cladding:init`, with no functional benefit. `clad init` no longer spawns `claude plugin install --scope project`.

---

## [0.3.60] — 2026-05-22 — `clad init` host wiring + lazy enrichment marker (F-90d054)

**Closing the onboarding marriage.** Until now `clad init` scaffolded `spec.yaml` + 4-tier docs but left every host AI wiring (Claude Code plugin / Codex skills / Gemini extension / MCP server / cross-tool AGENTS.md) to the user. And `npm`-path users had no way to populate the spec without an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — a real LLM gap vs the plugin-path. This cycle fuses both.

### Added

- **`scripts/postinstall.mjs`** — npm `postinstall` hook that wires the four host AI auto-discovery channels on `npm install -g cladding`:
  - `~/.claude/plugins/cladding` (symlink) — Claude Code global plugin
  - `~/.gemini/extensions/cladding` (symlink → `plugins/gemini-cli/`) — Gemini CLI extension
  - `~/.agents/skills/cladding-<verb>` (symlinks × N) — Codex CLI skills
  - `~/.codex/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.cladding]` (TOML merge, smol-toml) — Codex MCP server
- **`src/init/detect.ts`** — deterministic greenfield/brownfield detection with `observed_layers`, language, package manager, and test-file count.
- **`src/init/marker.ts`** — `_meta.enrichment_status: "pending"` marker + `enrichment_scope` checklist + `detected` ground-truth context. `patchMarkerInSpec` for idempotent re-runs (AC-012 — body preserved verbatim).
- **`src/init/host-instructions.ts`** — `AGENTS.md` template (cross-tool entry point + enrichment instruction) + `CLAUDE.md` `## cladding` section (idempotent append, never duplicates on re-init).
- **`src/init/postinstall-fallback.ts`** — `clad init` retries postinstall when `--ignore-scripts` skipped it.
- **OpenAI + Gemini dispatcher adapters** (`src/cli/scan/dispatcher.ts`) — fetch-based, no SDK dependency. `clad init` now auto-routes through `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `GEMINI_API_KEY` → MCP sampling → null (existing chain extended).
- **Detector #28 `ENRICHMENT_PENDING`** (warn) — `clad check` surfaces a pending marker; `clad check --strict` blocks CI on it.
- **Schema extension** — `spec.yaml._meta` top-level block (additive, optional). Existing specs unaffected.

### Changed

- `clad init` now also writes `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + `_meta` marker. Re-run on an initialised project preserves the spec body and only re-activates `enrichment_scope` items whose `detected` observations changed (AC-012).
- `package.json` — adds `smol-toml@^1.6.1` dependency (TOML merge) + `postinstall` lifecycle script + ships `plugins/`, `.mcp.json`, `scripts/postinstall.mjs` in `files[]`.
- `spec/architecture.yaml` — `init` layer added under foundation tier.
- Plugin manifests rebuilt to `28/28` detectors.

### Why

Two onboarding frictions blocked first-1000-user adoption:
1. **Host wiring was manual.** Plugin marketplace users got 1-click install; npm users had to copy `.claude-plugin/`, set up MCP server, manually register skills. The new postinstall + AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md writers close every channel automatically.
2. **The `npm` path had no LLM.** Plugin users got host LLM for free via MCP sampling; npm users got a deterministic floor. The new marker pattern delegates enrichment to whichever host AI opens the project first — cladding never holds API credentials, never bills the user, but the spec gets populated regardless.

Both paths now converge on the same enriched `spec.yaml` at the same moment (first AI task in the project).

### Implementation receipt — 1 cycle

- One feature shard: `spec/features/init-host-autowire-90d054.yaml` (F-90d054, 12 ACs, status `in_progress`).
- Touches: 4 new modules under `src/init/`, 1 new detector, 1 schema extension, 2 npm-lifecycle scripts. 1 new dep (smol-toml).
- 34 new tests across `tests/init/` + `tests/stages/enrichment-pending.test.ts`. Total 954 tests.
- AB-evaluation report baselines refreshed (intentional metric change: detector count 27 → 28).
- Gates: 954/954 tests · 28/28 detectors · 134 features valid · `clad check --strict` warns on `ENRICHMENT_PENDING` as designed.

## [0.3.59] — 2026-05-22 — ai_hints consumer instructions in CLAUDE.md + 5 personas (F-0ed2db)

**Closing the dead-data loop on preferred_patterns.** F-32b1e0 (v0.3.58) introduced `preferred_patterns` as an advisory `{when, prefer, over?}` channel — but nothing actually consumed it. CLAUDE.md and the persona prompts under `src/agents/` never referenced `ai_hints`, so AI sessions had no instruction to grep it at session start. This cycle makes the consumer real.

### Added

- **`CLAUDE.md` — "AI behavior guidance from `spec.yaml.project.ai_hints`"** — names all five `ai_hints` fields and explains the AI-readable policy stack alongside `docs/conventions.md` (style) and `docs/project-context.md` (why). `ai_hints` wins over CLAUDE.md when they conflict for a specific project (`ai_hints` is project-scoped SSoT; CLAUDE.md is the meta-instruction layer).
- **Persona prompts — `## Project policy` section in all 5 personas** (`src/agents/{specialists,librarian,reviewer,observability,orchestrator}.md`). Each persona's instruction is tailored to its role: specialists honor `preferred_patterns` when writing code; librarian restates them in AC notes when relevant; reviewer flags `over:`-path diffs as Consistency > Creativity violations; observability tracks detector #27 in the heatmap; orchestrator forwards the matching triple in the dispatch slice (Principle 5).

### Changed

- `npm run build:plugin` re-mirrored the 5 updated personas to `agents/` (Claude Code) + `plugins/codex/skills/` + `plugins/gemini-cli/commands/`. No code change in plugin manifest output beyond the persona text refresh.

### Why

`preferred_patterns` had schema + LLM emission + cladding-self triples, but `grep -r "ai_hints" CLAUDE.md src/agents/` returned 0 hits — dead data. A critical re-verification (this session) surfaced the gap: rather than revert F-32b1e0 or build a lint bridge (~500 LOC), spend ~30 LOC of doc to make `preferred_patterns` a session-start grep target. ROI > revert; revert > silent dead-data.

### Implementation receipt — 1 cycle

- One feature shard: `spec/features/ai-hints-consumer-instructions-0ed2db.yaml` (F-0ed2db, 4 ACs, all `done`).
- Touches: `CLAUDE.md` (~22 lines added), `src/agents/{5 personas}.md` (~5-8 lines each), mirrored copies under `agents/` + `plugins/`.
- No code change. No new detector. No new test (doc-only).
- Gates: 920/920 tests · 27/27 detectors · 133 features valid · `clad check --strict --internal` ✓.

## [0.3.58] — 2026-05-22 — ai_hints.preferred_patterns advisory (F-32b1e0)

**Companion to forbidden_patterns: positive guidance, not just negative.** F-00eb1a (v0.3.57) made `forbidden_patterns` a hard gate via detector #27. This cycle adds `preferred_patterns` as **advisory** — AI agents read `{when, prefer, over?}` triples at session start and self-follow. No detector enforces; ESLint already covers the AST-level part of "preferred patterns" and cladding sticks to declarative SSoT.

### Added

- `src/spec/types.ts::PreferredPattern` interface `{when, prefer, over?}` + `AiHints.preferred_patterns?: readonly PreferredPattern[]`
- `src/spec/schema.json` — `project.ai_hints.preferred_patterns` array of objects with `when` + `prefer` required and `over` optional (`additionalProperties: false`)
- `src/cli/scan/intent-onboarding.ts::OnboardingPreferredPattern` + `OnboardingAiHints.preferred_patterns`
- `PROJECT_METADATA` sentinel prompt now instructs the LLM to emit 1-3 domain-relevant triples (e.g. React → useState over class state, async work → async/await over callbacks)
- `extractProjectMetadata` parses the new field defensively — drops entries missing `when` or `prefer`, drops non-array root, ignores fully-malformed lists
- `tests/cli/intent-onboarding.test.ts` — 4 new tests for `preferred_patterns` parse cases (happy path, malformed entries dropped, non-array, all-malformed)

### Changed

- `src/cli/init.ts::SpecSeedMetadata.ai_hints` gains optional `preferred_patterns`; `specSeed` emits a multi-line block under `project.ai_hints:` when triples are present
- `hasAnyAiHint` recognizes `preferred_patterns` so the seed correctly chooses to emit `ai_hints:` even when only triples are present
- `spec.yaml` (cladding-self) — dogfooded with 4 preferred_patterns:
  - **new drift detector implementation** → synchronous + deterministic (Iron Law) over LLM-assisted detection
  - **spec authoring** → F-`<hash6>` sharded files over F-NNN sequential or inline
  - **AI agent file lookup** → 1-file grep against spec.yaml inventory + ai_hints over readdirSync on shards
  - **Iron Law stage logic + I/O orchestration** → pure stage core + CLI wrapper over mixed runner

### Notes

- 916 + **4 new tests** = **920/920 passing**
- lint clean · typecheck clean · build:plugin 27/27 detectors
- `clad sync` 131 → **132 features valid** (+F-32b1e0)
- `clad check --strict --internal` — stage_1.1-1.6 + 2.1-2.2 all ✓
- **No new detector** — `preferred_patterns` is advisory by design. AST-level preferred patterns are ESLint's job; cladding stays declarative

### The full ai_hints loop now reads

```yaml
project.ai_hints:
  preferred_persona: software-engineer       # who the AI agent acts as
  token_budget_per_session: 4000              # cap on session size
  test_framework: vitest                      # which test framework
  primary_branch: develop                     # where to PR
  forbidden_patterns: [...]                   # ❌ enforced (F-00eb1a)
  preferred_patterns:                         # ✅ advised (F-32b1e0)
    - when: ...
      prefer: ...
      over: ...
```

5 fields × 2 enforcement modes (gate / advise). AI agents grep one file and follow the whole policy.

### Roadmap

- **Lint config bridge** (next cycle candidate) — `ai_hints.lint_rules` as SSoT for `.eslintrc.json` (LINT_RULES_DRIFT detector)
- AI agent SDKs (Claude Code, Cursor) surface `preferred_patterns` automatically in their context window
- Per-feature `preferred_patterns_override` for legacy shards
- Severity tiers for preferred_patterns (info vs warn) — promote a few to enforced gate

---

## [0.3.57] — 2026-05-21 — AI_HINTS_FORBIDDEN_PATTERN detector + LLM-populated ai_hints (F-00eb1a)

**ai_hints graduates from advice to enforcement + becomes self-filling.** F-5b9f9f added the `project.ai_hints` block as a passive AI-agent guide. This cycle:

1. **Enforces** `forbidden_patterns` with detector **#27** (was 26) — every `src/**/*.ts(x)` line that matches a forbidden identifier substring emits an error finding. Opt-in: silent when `ai_hints` is absent or `forbidden_patterns` is empty. Comment lines (`//`, `/*`, `*`) skipped to avoid documentation false-positives.
2. **Auto-populates** ai_hints during `clad init --intent "..."` via a new `=== PROJECT_METADATA ===` sentinel. The LLM infers `preferred_persona`, `token_budget_per_session`, `test_framework`, `primary_branch`, `forbidden_patterns` from the user's intent — or returns an empty block when too vague.

### Added

- `src/stages/detectors/ai-hints-forbidden-pattern.ts` (new detector #27) — `walkTsFiles(src/)` + line-by-line substring match against `spec.project.ai_hints.forbidden_patterns`. Per-occurrence error findings with `path` + `line` context. `isCommentLine()` skips `//`, `/*`, `*` lines so the detector's own source (which mentions `eval(` and `innerHTML` in its docstring) doesn't trip itself
- `src/cli/scan/intent-onboarding.ts::OnboardingAiHints` interface + `extractProjectMetadata(raw)` parser that returns a partial OnboardingAiHints, dropping malformed YAML / non-object roots / wrong-typed fields / unknown keys
- `=== PROJECT_METADATA ===` sentinel in the onboarding LLM prompt with explicit guidance: include `innerHTML` + `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in `forbidden_patterns` for UI projects; focus on `eval(` + Function constructor + `child_process.exec` for Node/Deno; leave block EMPTY when too vague
- `parseOnboardingResponse` now extracts `projectMetadataRaw` (8 sentinels total, was 7)
- `tests/stages/ai-hints-forbidden-pattern.test.ts` — 7 tests covering no-ai_hints silent, empty-list silent, single match, comment skip, multi-pattern + multi-file, no-src silent, no-spec silent
- `tests/cli/intent-onboarding.test.ts` — 8 new tests for `extractProjectMetadata` (empty / full / partial / malformed / non-object / invalid-types / unknown-keys ignored)

### Changed

- `src/stages/detectors/index.ts` — registers `aiHintsForbiddenPattern`; **26 → 27 detectors** (auto-recounted by `build:plugin`)
- `src/cli/init.ts::SpecSeedMetadata` gains optional `ai_hints` block; `specSeed` emits a nested `project.ai_hints:` block (5 keys) when present; `runInit` passes `onboarding.aiHints` through so LLM-inferred hints reach spec.yaml automatically
- `OnboardingResult.aiHints` field added — undefined when LLM didn't return PROJECT_METADATA or when deterministic fallback fired

### Notes

- 899 + **15 new tests** = **914/914 passing** (7 detector + 8 onboarding parser)
- lint clean · typecheck clean · build:plugin **27/27 detectors**
- `clad sync` 130 → **131 features valid** (+F-00eb1a)
- `clad check --strict --internal` — stage_1.1-1.6 + 2.1-2.2 all ✓
- cladding-self has `forbidden_patterns: ["eval(", "innerHTML", "dangerouslySetInnerHTML"]` (from F-5b9f9f); none of cladding's TypeScript source actually uses these → detector stays silent on the project

### What this enables

| User journey | What happens now |
|---|---|
| `clad init --intent "React dashboard with charts"` | onboarding LLM infers ai_hints with `test_framework: vitest`, `preferred_persona: software-engineer`, `forbidden_patterns: ["innerHTML", "dangerouslySetInnerHTML"]` |
| dev later commits `el.innerHTML = "..."` to a React component | `AI_HINTS_FORBIDDEN_PATTERN` fires error finding; `clad check` fails before merge |
| dev runs `clad sync` after intentionally relaxing one pattern | spec.yaml updated; detector goes quiet for that pattern next run |

The advice→enforcement loop is fully closed. AI agents now BOTH read hints AND get gated by them.

### Roadmap

- Per-feature `ai_hints` override (e.g., `spec/features/legacy-*.yaml::ai_hints_override`)
- Severity tiers (`warn` vs `error`) per pattern
- Pattern whitelist exceptions (`forbidden_patterns_except_in: [tests/, scripts/]`)
- Cladding-self adopts strict mode (`forbidden_patterns` enforced in CI)

## [0.3.56] — 2026-05-21 — spec.yaml gains inventory + ai_hints (front-door uplift) (F-5b9f9f)

**spec.yaml goes from "thin manifest" to "queryable front-door".** Two new optional schema blocks:

- **`inventory:`** (top-level, auto-maintained by `clad sync`) — `features` / `scenarios` / `capabilities` / `test_files` counts + `last_synced` ISO date. AI agents grep ONE file and see the whole project's scale, instead of walking `spec/features/`, `spec/scenarios/`, `tests/` themselves.
- **`project.ai_hints:`** (user-authored) — `preferred_persona` / `token_budget_per_session` / `test_framework` / `primary_branch` / `forbidden_patterns`. AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, …) load this at session start so they don't have to rediscover conventions or re-grep CLAUDE.md.

Both blocks are **optional**, **backwards-compatible**, and pattern-stable: minimal `{schema, project: {name, language}, features: []}` spec.yaml still validates and runs.

### Added

- `src/spec/schema.json` — adds `inventory` (top-level, additionalProperties: false) + `project.ai_hints` (additionalProperties: false). Both have JSON Schema descriptions visible to consuming validators
- `src/spec/types.ts::Inventory` + `AiHints` interfaces with full JSDoc. `Spec.inventory` + `Project.ai_hints` optional
- `src/spec/inventory.ts` (new module) — `computeInventory(cwd)` walks the disk to produce the counts. `writeInventoryToSpecYaml(cwd, inv)` line-based rewrite of the `inventory:` block preserving comments + key ordering. Pure `upsertInventoryBlock(body, inv)` for unit testing
- `tests/spec/inventory.test.ts` — 8 unit tests (compute on empty/populated trees, capabilities count, test-file walk, upsert append + replace + round-trip + no-op)

### Changed

- `src/cli/clad.ts::runSyncCommand` — calls `writeInventoryToSpecYaml` unconditionally on every invocation so the block stays fresh. ISO-date `last_synced` keeps spec.yaml commit-stable across same-day runs
- `spec.yaml` (cladding-self) — gains `project.ai_hints` (preferred_persona: software-engineer · token_budget 4000 · test_framework vitest · primary_branch develop · forbidden_patterns: `eval(`, `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) + auto-emitted `inventory:` block (129 features / 2 scenarios / 5 capabilities / 94 test_files)

### Notes

- 891 + 8 new tests = **899/899 passing**
- lint clean · typecheck clean · build:plugin 26/26 detectors
- `clad sync` → **130 features valid** (+F-5b9f9f)
- `clad check --strict --internal` → stage_1.1-1.6 + 2.1-2.2 all ✓
- Inventory uses YYYY-MM-DD (not full ISO-8601 with time) so multiple sync runs on the same day produce identical spec.yaml content — no commit churn

### Front-door uplift — cladding-self spec.yaml in ~30 lines

Before this cycle: 16 lines (manifest + 4 metadata fields). After: ~30 lines that fully describe the project + tell AI agents how to behave + cache shard counts. Open spec.yaml — know the project.

### Roadmap (followups)

- LLM-populated `ai_hints` via onboarding sentinel (`clad init --intent` reads intent → emits sensible defaults)
- Detector that checks code for `forbidden_patterns` from `project.ai_hints` — turn this from advice into enforcement
- `tier_index:` in spec.yaml for non-standard layouts (currently hardcoded)
- `inventory.last_synced_drift_warn` if last_synced > N days → telemetry hint

## [0.3.55] — 2026-05-21 — A/B-extended curators emit scenario shards · H10 verdict ⚠️ → ✅ (F-f334fa)

**The final closure on the AB track.** Both extended curators (task-manager + dashboard) now emit 3 user-journey scenario shards each under `spec/scenarios/`. Q5 of the AI-query benchmark ("How many test scenarios are declared?") graduates from a **5-file weak proxy** (counting test files because no scenarios existed) to a **1-directory canonical answer** (cladding declares 3 shards, vanilla still falls back). Low-cost ≤1-file answer rate climbs **2/5 → 3/5** in both scenarios; H10 cross-scenario verdict upgrades **⚠️ partial → ✅ supported with caveat**.

### Added

- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_curator.ts::emitTaskManagerScenarios(cwd)` + `renderScenarioShard(s)` + 3 scenarios:
  - **S-3525f0 first-time-onboarding** — new user adds + completes their first task; binds app-shell + add-task + task-list + mark-complete
  - **S-b53dd9 power-user-bulk** — heavy user filters by status+priority + bulk-clear; binds status-filter + filter-by-priority + bulk-delete
  - **S-560c61 data-portability** — JSON export/import round-trip; binds json-export + localstorage
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_curator-dashboard.ts::emitDashboardScenarios(cwd)` + 3 scenarios:
  - **S-1f9cfa metrics-monitoring** — operator scans KPI cards; binds app-shell + time-range-selector + metric-card + trend-card + comparison-card + refresh-interval
  - **S-8c1eaa alert-triage** — on-call dismisses alerts; binds alert-card + status-card
  - **S-7b6503 preference-customization** — density + layout adjust; binds preferences-panel + layout-customization + density-control + export-config

### Changed

- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/report.md` (auto-regenerated) — Q5 now reports `1 file → 3 scenario shard(s)` (was `5 file → test-file weak proxy`). Low-cost answer rate `2/5` → **3/5**
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/dashboard/report.md` (auto-regenerated) — same Q5 upgrade; Low-cost rate **3/5**
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/summary.md`:
  - At-a-glance table — AI ≤1-file: `2/5` → **3/5**, tier-banner files: `35` → `38` (per scenario, +3 scenario shards)
  - H10 cross-scenario verdict: `⚠️ partial (Q5 limit)` → **✅ supported with caveat** (the caveat now narrowed to Q1/Q2 linear-scan, not the absent-shard limit)
  - Cross-scenario findings #3 rewritten — describes the 3/5 result + the remaining Q1/Q2 ceiling (a real `grep -l`-style simulation would push it to 5/5)

### Notes

- 891/891 tests passing (snapshot gate compares regenerated reports — passes after `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1` once)
- lint clean · typecheck clean · build:plugin 26/26 detectors
- `clad sync` 129 → **130 features valid** (+F-f334fa)
- `clad check --strict --internal` — stage_1.1-1.6 + 2.1-2.2 all ✓
- 6 scenario shards are deterministic (hash derived from slug via SHA-256 first 6 hex). Re-running curator produces identical shards
- Vanilla group unchanged — still has no `spec/scenarios/` so still falls back to test-file count for Q5

### What "AB-마무리" looks like now

- 3/4 cladding-exclusive drift catches at every scale, every domain
- 3/5 ≤1-file AI queries (Q3/Q4/Q5 perfectly answered; Q1/Q2 bounded by naive linear-scan implementation)
- 2 fully runnable React projects per scenario (regeneratable via UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1)
- All 12 hypotheses verified: 8 ✅, 1 ⚠️-with-known-limit, 3 marked resolved-by-later-H

The remaining limitation (Q1/Q2 linear scan) is **implementation-bounded**, not framework-bounded. A future `grep -l`-style query simulator would close to 5/5.

### Roadmap

- `grep -l`-style query simulation in `_query-bench.ts` to push 3/5 → 5/5
- README.md `Why cladding?` section publishing AB results
- LLM-populated spec.yaml metadata via onboarding sentinel
- Browser screenshot diff per scenario

## [0.3.54] — 2026-05-21 — Uncommit A/B-extended demo React projects to reduce repo bloat (F-9a3b61)

**The four committed React demo projects under `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/{task-manager,dashboard}/{cladding,vanilla}/` were ~160 files / ~10K LoC of regeneratable bloat.** This cycle removes them from the tracked tree and adds `.gitignore` rules so they stay local-only when regenerated via `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1`.

### Removed

- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/cladding/` (~50 files · React app + 30 spec shards + governance)
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/vanilla/` (~25 files · React app only)
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/dashboard/cladding/` (~55 files · React app + 30 spec shards + governance)
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/dashboard/vanilla/` (~30 files · React app only)

### Added

- `.gitignore` patterns: `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/*/cladding/` + `*/vanilla/` — future regenerations stay local-only

### Changed

- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/README.md` — clarifies that the React demo projects are **regeneratable on demand** via `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1`, not committed. "Browse + run" section now leads with the regenerate step
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/summary.md` — "How to browse + run" section updated to the regenerate-then-inspect-then-delete workflow

### Preserved

- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/report.md` (metric snapshot · committed)
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/dashboard/report.md` (metric snapshot · committed)
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/README.md` + `summary.md` (methodology + cross-scenario findings)
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/` (curator + case tests · live code)

### Workflow change

**Before**: `cd docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/cladding && npm install && npm run dev` (worked off committed source)

**After**:
```bash
UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1 npx vitest run tests/scenarios/ab-extended/   # regenerates the 4 dirs
cd docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/cladding   # now exists locally
npm install && npm run dev
```

The committed `report.md` carries the evaluation result permanently. The React source is reproducible from the curator on every run — no information loss.

### Notes

- 891/891 tests passing (snapshot gate compares `report.md`, unaffected by source-tree removal)
- repo size: docs/ab-evaluation-extended `920K` → `~50K` (~94% reduction)
- file count under `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/`: `222` → `2` (just the two `report.md` files)

## [0.3.53] — 2026-05-21 — A/B extended scenario 2: 30-feature analytics dashboard + cross-scenario AB-마무리 (F-ef2fd9)

**Declares AB-마무리 (AB-evaluation wrap-up) complete.** The framework now ships **two** complete 30-feature React scenarios — task-manager (F-0144b9, scenario 1) + dashboard (this cycle, scenario 2) — proving cladding's value generalizes across domains. Both scenarios produce **identical 3/4 cladding-exclusive drift catch rates at M30**. The cross-scenario summary (`docs/ab-evaluation-extended/summary.md`) is now the authoritative answer to "where does cladding's design pay off?".

### Added

- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_shared-scaffold.ts` (new module) — React 19 + Vite 6 + TS 5.6 + Tailwind 4 boilerplate templates (package.json, tsconfig, vite.config, tailwind.config, index.html, index.css, main.tsx, README, .gitignore, tests/_setup.ts). Reused by both scenario curators
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_feature-set-dashboard.ts` (new module) — 30 dashboard features across 5 categories: layout (8) · cards (8) · charts (5) · data (5) · preferences (4). Deterministic F-hash6 ids
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_curator-dashboard.ts` (new module) — emits the complete React analytics dashboard for either group. Includes 17 components (Sidebar, Breadcrumbs, TimeRangeSelector, 7 card types, 5 inline-SVG charts, CardSkeleton, ErrorState, EmptyState, PreferencesPanel) + 4 hooks + 3 lib modules + 3 vitest test files
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/case-dashboard.test.ts` — scenario 2 driver: same 7-milestone progression + 4 drift scenarios + 5 AI queries as task-manager; uses `featureKeyword: 'metric-card'` for Q1/Q2
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/dashboard/report.md` (auto-generated) — milestone progression + M30 drift + AI-query benchmark
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/dashboard/cladding/` (browseable, runnable) — full dashboard React project + cladding governance scaffold
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/dashboard/vanilla/` (browseable, runnable) — same React app, no governance

### Changed

- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/summary.md` — rewritten as the cross-scenario verdict matrix. Both scenarios share **3/4 cladding-exclusive drift catches**, **~0.5 spec/code ratio**, **35 tier-banner files at M30**. H9 / H11 / H12 verified to be **domain-independent**
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/README.md` — scenarios table updated; dashboard moved from "planned" to "shipped"

### Key M30 results (dashboard)

| Metric | Cladding | Vanilla |
|---|---:|---:|
| Tier-banner files | **35** | 0 |
| Features tracked | **30** | 0 |
| ACs tracked | **31** | 0 |
| Capability bindings | **5** | 0 |
| Source LoC | 849 | 849 |
| Spec LoC | **420** | 0 |
| Spec/code ratio | **0.49** | 0.00 |
| **Drift catch (M30)** | **3/4** | **0/3** |
| AI ≤1-file queries | 2/5 | 0/5 |

### Cross-scenario findings (AB-마무리)

| Hypothesis | task-manager M30 | dashboard M30 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| H9 — Linear scale | spec/code 0.55 | 0.49 | **✅ domain-independent** |
| H11 — Drift catch preserved at scale | 3/4 cladding-exclusive | 3/4 cladding-exclusive | **✅ identical across domains** |
| H12 — Capture duration bounded | <2s | <2s | ✅ |

The drift detectors that fire are **identical in both scenarios**: `MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION + STATUS_DRIFT` (file rename), `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC` (forbidden import), `MISSING_TESTS` (untested AC). These three define cladding's structural payoff at any scale and any domain.

### Notes

- 890 + **1 new dashboard case test** = **891/891** passing
- lint clean · typecheck clean · build:plugin 26/26 detectors
- `clad sync` → **127 features valid** (+F-ef2fd9)
- `clad check --strict --internal` → all active stages ✓
- Both committed dashboard projects (cladding + vanilla) are runnable React apps — `npm install && npm run dev` opens at http://localhost:5173

### Roadmap (out of scope)

- Browser screenshot diffs for visual UI verification
- `vite build` bundle size measurement per scenario per group
- Actually-run-vitest in committed projects
- Scenario 3 (blog/CMS, e-commerce, …) — on demand only

## [0.3.52] — 2026-05-21 — Parameterize Q1/Q2 of AI-query benchmark per scenario (F-ae61c1)

**Resolves the H10 ⚠️ partial verdict from F-0144b9.** The 5-question AI-query benchmark had Q1 ("Which feature implements the refund flow?") and Q2 ("How many ACs does the refund flow have?") hardcoded to the payment domain. Task-manager has no "refund flow" feature → Q1/Q2 reported `not found` and "N" (unanswerable) regardless of cladding scaffold quality. This cycle parameterizes the keyword.

### Added

- `tests/scenarios/ab/_query-bench.ts::QueryBenchOptions` (new interface) — `{featureKeyword, featureLabel}` optional config so any scenario can target its own representative feature
- `makeQ1(keyword, label)` + `makeQ2(keyword, label)` factories — replace the previous fixed `Q1`/`Q2` consts. Case-insensitive substring match; query text/answer surfaces use the supplied label

### Changed

- `answerAllQueries(cwd, opts?)` signature — accepts optional `QueryBenchOptions`. Defaults to `{featureKeyword: 'refund', featureLabel: 'refund flow'}` so existing payment-saas + existing-adoption tests run **unchanged** (backwards-compat 100%)
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/case-task-manager.test.ts` — passes `{featureKeyword: 'add-task', featureLabel: 'add-task flow'}` so Q1/Q2 actually find the task-manager `add-task` feature shard
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/report.md` (auto-regenerated) — Q1 now reports `F-3cbf38` (add-task feature id); Q2 reports `3 AC(s)`. Both answerable in cladding tree, unanswerable in vanilla
- `tests/scenarios/ab/` reports unchanged — 'refund flow' default preserved

### Notes

- 890/890 tests passing
- The remaining `low-cost answers (≤1 file)` ratio at task-manager M30 stays 2/5 (Q3+Q4 = architecture+capabilities = 1 file each; Q1+Q2 = 2 files because the linear scan opens add-category before add-task; Q5 = 5 files because task-manager doesn't ship scenario shards). Honest measurement; future scenarios with scenario shards would push Q5 to 1
- H10 verdict in `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/summary.md` upgraded from ⚠️ partial → ✅ supported with caveat (linear-scan order dependent)

### Roadmap

- Q5 could be ≤1 file by curating scenario shards in `_curator.ts` for task-manager (next cycle)
- AI agent benchmark could simulate `grep -l` (single operation) instead of linear scan — closer to real LLM behavior

---

## [0.3.51] — 2026-05-21 — Enrich spec.yaml with project metadata (F-3a5339)

**Reviewer caught a dogfood gap**: both cladding-self's own `spec.yaml` and the A/B-extended task-manager's `spec.yaml` were 12-line shells (header comment + `schema: "0.1"` + `project: {name, language}`). Sharded layout works, but the spec.yaml as a "front door" was uninformative. This cycle extends the Project schema with 4 optional metadata fields so spec.yaml carries meaningful first-line content while staying backwards-compatible.

### Added

- `src/spec/schema.json` — `project.properties` adds `description`, `version`, `repository`, `intent_summary` as optional string fields. `additionalProperties: false` stays — only these 4 new keys are allowed alongside name + language
- `src/spec/types.ts::Project` — 4 readonly optional fields with doc comments noting v0.3.49 addition and the "minimal spec.yaml stays valid" backward-compat promise
- `src/cli/init.ts::SpecSeedMetadata` (new interface) + `specSeed(name, language, metadata?)` signature extension. When an intent is provided to `runInit`, the metadata defaults to `{description: oneLine(intent), intent_summary: oneLine(intent)}` so spec.yaml's front door is never just name + language for intent-aware projects. Version defaults to `"0.0.1"` when not provided; repository stays unset
- `oneLine(text)` helper that collapses whitespace + truncates to 120 chars for description/intent_summary defaults

### Changed

- `spec.yaml` (cladding-self) — populated with real metadata: `description: "Reference implementation of the Ironclad harness for AI-coupled software."`, `version: "0.3.49"`, `repository: "https://github.com/qwerfunch/cladding"`, `intent_summary` summarizing cladding's 26-detector + 4-tier-SSoT value proposition
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_curator.ts::CLADDING_SPEC_YAML` — task-manager template gains 4 metadata fields with task-manager-specific values
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/cladding/spec.yaml` (auto-regenerated) — committed enriched output so reviewers see the new front door immediately
- `docs/ab-evaluation/case-payment-saas.md` + `case-existing-adoption.md` (auto-regenerated) — metric counts shift slightly because the seeded spec.yaml + the LLM-stamped seeds in their reports now include the new metadata; catch rate of 3/4 cladding-exclusive drift catches preserved

### Notes

- 890/890 tests passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- `build:plugin` recomputed 26/26 detectors (no detector added)
- `clad sync` → **124 features valid** (was 123, +F-3a5339)
- `clad check --strict --internal` → stage_1.1-1.6 + 2.1-2.2 all ✓
- All 4 new fields are optional. Legacy minimal spec.yaml files (the 12-line shell prior to this cycle) remain valid with no migration required
- Existing META_INTEGRITY detector still requires only `[schema, project, features]` at the top level — unchanged

### Roadmap (next cycles)

- **LLM-populated metadata via intent-onboarding**: have the LLM dispatcher emit a `=== PROJECT_METADATA ===` sentinel so the description / intent_summary are richer than the verbatim intent line
- **Feature shard metadata**: similar `owner` / `since` / `risk_tier` optional fields on Feature
- **Scenario shard metadata**: personas / acceptance journey
- **Capability shard metadata**: stage / maturity_tier

## [0.3.50] — 2026-05-21 — A/B extended: 30-feature task-manager React project (F-0144b9)

**The original A/B framework (F-4db939 / F-ba2e05) measured cladding's value at 1 feature/case. This cycle scales to 30 features × 1 UI scenario** (React 19 + Vite 6 + TS 5.6 + Tailwind 4 task-manager) and ships **two complete runnable React projects** committed to the repo so reviewers can `cd` in and `npm run dev`. The previous "where does cladding pay off?" finding (3/4 cladding-exclusive drift catches at 1-feature scale) is verified to **hold at 30× scale** — cladding's value compounds, not flattens.

### Added

- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_feature-set.ts` (new module) — defines 30 task-manager features across 5 categories (UI foundation 8, CRUD 10, Filter/Search 5, Categories/Tags 5, Persistence 2). Each feature has deterministic F-hash6 id derived from slug, modules list, ACs with `test_refs`, and a category tag for milestone grouping. `featuresAtMilestone(N)` returns the first N features
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_curator.ts` (new module) — emits a complete React 19 + Vite 6 + TS 5.6 + Tailwind 4 task-manager project for either group at the given cwd. Cladding group gets full scaffold (spec.yaml, 30 sharded `spec/features/*.yaml`, `spec/architecture.yaml`, `spec/capabilities.yaml`, `docs/project-context.md`, `docs/conventions.md`). Vanilla group gets the same React source minus governance. Output is byte-deterministic across runs
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_perf-meter.ts` (new module) — `capturePerfSnapshot(group, milestone, cwd)` times the existing `captureSnapshot` via `performance.now()` and tracks src LoC / test LoC / spec LoC / file counts / spec-to-code ratio. Duration uses 500ms+ buckets to absorb wall-clock jitter
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/_report-extended.ts` (new module) — renders a deterministic markdown report with 7-milestone progression table (M01..M30), drift catch matrix, AI-query benchmark, H9-H12 verdicts. Re-exports `writeOrAssertReport` for the snapshot gate
- `tests/scenarios/ab-extended/case-task-manager.test.ts` — the driver: curates both tmpdirs progressively at 7 milestones, captures perf snapshots, applies 4 drift scenarios + 5 AI queries at M30, writes report. Under `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1`, also recurates the final M30 state into the committed `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/{cladding,vanilla}/` directories
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/README.md` (new) — methodology + 4 explicit limitations (vanilla still simulated; AI queries currently domain-tuned to payment; AC count includes shard inflation; capture duration in 500ms buckets)
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/summary.md` (new) — cross-scale findings table comparing small-scale (F-ba2e05) vs large-scale (F-0144b9) numbers + 12-hypothesis verdict matrix
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/report.md` (auto-generated) — per-scenario milestone progression + M30 drift catches + AI queries + H9-H12 verdicts
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/cladding/` (~50 files, runnable) — full React 19 task-manager project with cladding scaffold. `cd && npm install && npm run dev` opens at http://localhost:5173
- `docs/ab-evaluation-extended/scenarios/task-manager/vanilla/` (~30 files, runnable) — same React app source minus cladding governance

### Key results at M30 (30 features)

- **Tier-banner files**: cladding 35 vs vanilla 0 (spec.yaml + 30 feature shards + architecture + capabilities + project-context + conventions + scenarios README)
- **Features tracked**: cladding 30 vs vanilla 0
- **ACs tracked**: cladding 34 vs vanilla 0
- **Capability bindings**: cladding 5 capabilities mapped to features vs vanilla 0
- **Architecture rules**: cladding declares 2 layers + 0 forbidden-import rules vs vanilla 0 (the canonical 2-tier layout uses string[][] schema; forbidden_imports from object-form per-layer entries normalize fine via F-99c6e5's dual-schema support)
- **Source LoC**: 739 (identical, same React app)
- **Spec/code ratio**: cladding 0.55, vanilla 0.00 — every 100 LoC of code is matched by 55 LoC of spec
- **Drift catch at M30**: cladding 3/4, vanilla 0/3 — **3 cladding-exclusive catches preserved at 30× scale**

### Hypothesis verdicts (new for this cycle)

- **H9** Cladding scales linearly: ✅ spec/code ratio bounded at 0.55 from M05 onward; spec LoC grows linearly with feature count (71 → 436)
- **H10** AI query cost stays bounded: ⚠️ partial — Q3 + Q4 answer in ≤1 file regardless of N; Q1/Q2 weak because the query set is currently payment-domain-tuned (mentions "refund flow" which task-manager doesn't have). Follow-up: task-manager-specific query set
- **H11** Drift catch preserved at scale: ✅ 3/4 cladding-exclusive at N=30 (identical rate to N=1)
- **H12** Capture duration bounded: ✅ snapshot capture at M30 stayed in the 1-2s bucket (same as M01) — detector loop scales with tree size, not feature count

### Notes

- 889 + **1 new extended case test** = **890/890** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Extended test runtime: ~33s (14 snapshots × 25 detectors). Total `npm test` runtime: ~50s
- `clad sync` 123 + F-0144b9 = **124 features valid**
- `build:plugin` recomputed 26/26 detectors (no new detector added this cycle)
- Both committed React projects pass `tsc --noEmit` against their own tsconfigs (not run as part of cladding's own typecheck — they're standalone projects with their own dependencies)
- The committed projects use **placeholder secret literals** in the export-import test fixture (e.g., `LEAKED_API_KEY = "sk_live_drift_test_REPLACE_ME_..."`) — surfaced by `HARDCODED_SECRET` only after DI-3 injection during the test, not statically

### Roadmap (out of scope for this cycle)

- **Scenario 2 (dashboard)**: next cycle. Reuses framework. Same 30-feature scale
- **Scenario 3 (blog/CMS)**: cycle after. Same pattern
- **Task-manager-specific query bench**: Q1/Q2 fixes — query for "add-task" feature instead of "refund flow" (or parameterize)
- **Actually run vitest in committed projects**: currently only state captured, not test results. Add a CI step that exercises `npm test` in each committed group
- **Bundle size**: measure `vite build` output (gzip + raw) per group per scenario; would surface another performance dimension
- **Browser screenshot capture**: render the UI to PNG, commit alongside the source for visual diff

## [0.3.49] — 2026-05-21 — cladding self-fixes: dual architecture schema + sharded F-001 + ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE (F-99c6e5)

**F-ba2e05 surfaced three real cladding bugs that the user-facing flow papered over.** This cycle fixes all three. The A/B framework's outcome quality measurement had to work around them with `claddingifyForDriftCatch` — that helper is now obsolete since the bugs themselves are resolved.

### Added

- `src/stages/detectors/absence-of-governance.ts` (new detector, #26) — the missing-scaffold detector promised by the F-ba2e05 limitation. Graduated severity: `spec.yaml` absent → **error**; `spec/architecture.yaml` + `spec/capabilities.yaml` + `docs/project-context.md` absent → **warn** each; `docs/conventions.md` + empty `spec/scenarios/` → **info** each. Every finding includes a `clad init --intent "<your goal>"` remediation hint. The other 25 detectors silently pass on a vanilla tree; this one explicitly flags the missing scaffold. Registered in `src/stages/detectors/index.ts` (25 → **26**); `build:plugin` recomputed `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to `26/26`
- `tests/stages/absence-of-governance.test.ts` — 7 tests covering empty tree (6 findings across all severities), spec.yaml-only-missing (1 error), full scaffold (0 findings), scenarios-readme-only-no-shards (1 info), Tier-B-only-missing (3 warn / 0 error), remediation hint presence, and idempotency
- `src/spec/types.ts::ArchitectureLayerObject` — new interface for the object-form architecture schema. `Architecture.layers` is now `readonly (readonly string[] | ArchitectureLayerObject)[]` — both forms valid

### Changed

- `src/spec/schema.json` — `architecture.layers` items use `oneOf` to accept either `array<string>` (canonical) or `{name, modules, forbidden_imports[]}` (object form). LLM-emitted onboarding artifacts no longer fail spec validation
- `src/stages/detectors/architecture-from-spec.ts` — `collectLayers` replaced by `normalizeArchitecture(arch)` returning canonical `{layers: Set, forbiddenImports: {from,to}[]}`. Per-layer object-form `forbidden_imports[]` entries normalize to `{from: layer.name, to: forbid}` pairs; canonical top-level rules merge in. Both shapes (or mixed) now produce the same enforcement
- `src/cli/init.ts::specSeed` — emits `features: []` instead of inline F-001 placeholder. New `f001SeedShard(seedTitle)` writes the placeholder feature to `spec/features/F-001-first.yaml`. The sharded loader (`spec/load.ts::loadSpec`) now activates from day one — every user-authored `spec/features/<slug>-<hash>.yaml` is immediately visible to MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION, AC_DRIFT, UNTESTED_AC, REFERENCE_INTEGRITY, etc.
- `src/cli/init.ts::runInit` — writes both `spec.yaml` and `spec/features/F-001-first.yaml` in step 1; idempotent on re-run; `created[]` reports both paths
- `tests/scenarios/architecture-from-spec.test.ts` — 3 new tests covering object-form happy path, object-form forbidden_imports violation detection, and canonical + object form composition (13 tests total, was 10)
- `tests/cli/init.test.ts` — seed assertion updated: spec.yaml must have `features: []`; F-001 content (id, AC-001, ears) verified in the sharded file instead
- `tests/scenarios/greenfield-lifecycle.test.ts` — S1 assertion checks `F-001-first.yaml` body for intent-derived title instead of spec.yaml inline
- `docs/ab-evaluation/case-payment-saas.md` + `case-existing-adoption.md` (auto-regenerated) — F-001-first.yaml shard inflates tier A count by 1, feature count by 1, AC count by 1, est. token count slightly. **Catch rate of 3/4 cladding-exclusive drift catches preserved**. `claddingifyForDriftCatch` workaround is now mostly redundant since the underlying bugs are fixed, but kept in `_drift-injection.ts` as defense-in-depth (some users may still have legacy spec.yaml with inline F-001)
- `src/stages/detectors/README.md` — added row 21 `ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE` to catalog

### Notes

- 879 + **10 new tests** = **889/889** passing (architecture-from-spec +3, absence-of-governance +7)
- Lint clean; typecheck clean; build:plugin recomputed 26/26 detectors
- `clad sync` → 122 + F-99c6e5 = **123 features valid**
- `clad check --strict --internal` → stage_1.1-1.6 + 2.1-2.2 all ✓
- The three bugs were independently triaged from F-ba2e05's `docs/ab-evaluation/summary.md` Future Work table; this cycle resolves all three "High" priority items
- New cladding-adopting projects: from `clad init` they immediately benefit from full detector coverage (no manual `features: []` cleanup needed). Existing cladding-managed projects: unaffected by the seed change since `--force` is required to overwrite; if they want sharded loading they can manually move inline F-001 to `spec/features/F-001-first.yaml`

### Roadmap

- Migration helper for existing projects: `clad migrate --to-sharded` that moves inline features to per-feature shards
- ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE configurable severity per project (some teams want all-warn instead of error)
- Architecture object-form linter that prefers canonical when both could express the same rule (style consistency)

## [0.3.48] — 2026-05-21 — Outcome quality measurement — drift injection + AI-query benchmark (F-ba2e05)

**Reviewer caught the gap in F-4db939**: structural metrics (tier banners, spec completeness, layer count) showed cladding produces more artifacts, but didn't answer "where does the design actually pay off?" — what's the **outcome quality** difference, where does cladding catch what vanilla misses? This cycle closes that gap with two new measurement dimensions: **drift injection** (4 deterministic drift events → which detectors fire?) and **AI-query benchmark** (5 domain questions → how many files must an agent open to answer?). Per-case reports now carry a `§ Outcome Quality` section with the catch matrix and query benchmark.

### Added

- `tests/scenarios/ab/_drift-injection.ts` (new module) — 4 drift scenario factories: `makeStaleReferenceDrift` (file rename without spec update → fires `MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION` + `STATUS_DRIFT`), `makeArchitectureViolationDrift` (forbidden import added → fires `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC`), `makeHardcodedSecretDrift` (secret literal injected → would fire `HARDCODED_SECRET` if secretlint installed), `makeUntestedAcDrift` (AC added to status:done feature without test → fires `MISSING_TESTS`). `captureDriftCatch(cwd, group, scenario)` snapshots all 25 detectors before + after, returns the diff. `claddingifyForDriftCatch(cwd, arch)` upgrades a freshly-onboarded tmpdir to a state where spec-gated detectors actually evaluate — clears the inline F-001 placeholder + rewrites architecture.yaml in canonical schema. Both transforms surface real cladding bugs (tracked in summary §Future Work)
- `tests/scenarios/ab/_query-bench.ts` (new module) — 5 deterministic domain questions: Q1 refund feature location, Q2 refund AC count, Q3 architecture forbidden-imports, Q4 capability ↔ feature bindings, Q5 test scenario count. Each query has a deterministic answer function that opens the minimum files needed. `answerAllQueries(cwd)` returns `QueryAnswer[]` with `answered: bool` + `filesOpened: number` + `answer: string`. Q3 handles both seed (object) and canonical (top-level + nested) architecture formats
- `tests/scenarios/ab/_report.ts` — extended with `OutcomeReportInput` (driftResults + queryResults) and `renderOutcomeSection(outcome)` that produces the new `§ Outcome Quality` block: drift catch table with ✅/·/N-A cells, AI-query benchmark table, aggregate catch-rate + answerability stats, "What this means" narrative covering H6 + H7 + H8
- `tests/scenarios/ab/case-payment-saas.test.ts` — extended M2 with claddingify step + 4 drift scenarios + 5 queries; F-4db939 shard upgraded to `status: done` + `test_refs: [tests/refund.test.ts]` so MISSING_TESTS can evaluate; payment-auth capability rebound from cleared F-001 placeholder to real F-4db939
- `tests/scenarios/ab/case-existing-adoption.test.ts` — extended same way; capability binding now uses yaml round-trip (robust to whichever LLM-vs-deterministic path emitted the file)

### Changed

- `docs/ab-evaluation/case-payment-saas.md` (auto-regenerated) — gained `§ Outcome Quality` section. **3/4 drift scenarios caught by cladding, 0 by vanilla** (DI-1 MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION + STATUS_DRIFT, DI-2 ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC, DI-4 MISSING_TESTS; DI-3 N/A in tmpdir). AI-query: A answers 5/5 in ≤1 file, B answers 0/5 in ≤1 file
- `docs/ab-evaluation/case-existing-adoption.md` (auto-regenerated) — identical 3/4 outcome with util→lib violation pattern
- `docs/ab-evaluation/summary.md` — H4 reframed from "partial caveat" to "RESOLVED by H6 drift injection"; new H6, H7, H8 verdicts added; outcome dimension wired into the at-a-glance + future-work tables; honest note that DI-3 doesn't fire in tmpdir (no secretlint)

### Notes

- 879 + **2 case tests re-run** (same files, more assertions) = **879/879 passing**; lint clean; typecheck clean
- A/B runtime: ~20s combined (was ~5.2s — drift injection runs all 25 detectors 8 times per case)
- The framework surfaces two real cladding bugs that the user-facing flow papers over: (1) LLM-emitted onboarding artifacts use object-form architecture (`name`/`forbidden_imports[]`) which the `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC` detector cannot read (expects canonical `string[][]` + `{from,to}[]`); (2) `init`-seeded spec.yaml's inline F-001 placeholder blocks sharded feature loading via the `spec.load.ts` heuristic. Both tracked in summary §Future Work; the tests work around them via `claddingifyForDriftCatch`. Without these fixes the catch rate would be 1/4 instead of 3/4 — surfacing these as cladding bugs is itself a finding of this cycle
- Honest acknowledgments retained: DI-3 (hardcoded secret baseline) doesn't fire on either group in tmpdir context because secretlint/gitleaks aren't installed; in production both groups would catch it equally. DI-4 is N/A on vanilla by construction (no AC concept)

### Roadmap

- `ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE` detector — convert vanilla's silent-pass into actionable signal so trees without cladding scaffolding get flagged
- Fix `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC` schema mismatch — make detector accept both object and canonical forms, or migrate seeds to canonical
- Run vitest in tmpdirs to confirm test suites actually pass on both groups (currently only the source code is curated, not executed)
- M3 milestone (3-feature cumulative state) — show whether drift-catch compounds over time
- Live-run mode (real Claude Code transcripts replayed deterministically)

## [0.3.47] — 2026-05-21 — A/B evaluation framework — Cladding vs Vanilla Claude Code (F-4db939)

**Lifecycle tests proved cladding's mechanics; A/B evaluation proves its value.** F-4747ef shipped 6-stage lifecycle tests that verify the 4-tier model *works* — every artifact lands, every banner is present, every detector emits zero errors. But "it works" is not the same as "it's better than not using it." This cycle adds a controlled comparison framework: two cases × two milestones × two groups (cladding vs vanilla Claude Code) = 8 snapshots, each measured across 8 dimensions, rendered into deterministic markdown reports committed to `docs/ab-evaluation/`. The reports are produced by tests, so a regression in the underlying mechanics fails CI; the markdowns themselves stand as research-quality evaluation documents readable by humans.

### Added

- `tests/scenarios/ab/_ab-metrics.ts` (new module) — `captureSnapshot(group, milestone, cwd)` reads a tmpdir and returns an `AbSnapshot` covering 8 dimensions: `tieredArtifactCount` (per-tier count from `head -1` banner detection), `specCompleteness` (features × ACs × scenarios × capabilities + bindings), `layerCompliance` (layers + forbidden-import rules), `crossDocConsistency` (25-detector run with META_INTEGRITY + HARDCODED_SECRET excluded as toolchain-only), `documentation` (tiered vs other doc sizes), `codeStructure` (source/test files + LoC), `tokenConsumption` (cumulative chars + chars/4 tokens), `testCoverage` (file count + regex-counted test cases). `diffToRows(a, b)` emits MetricRow[] for the markdown tables
- `tests/scenarios/ab/_vanilla-sim.ts` (new module) — pre-curated **smart vanilla Claude Code** sessions: `VANILLA_PAYMENT_SAAS_SESSION` (11 files / ~250 LoC across M1 + M2: package.json with zod + express + vitest, tsconfig, README with Install/Usage/API, src/api/payment.ts with zod validation, src/lib/pg.ts unified PG client, src/util/log.ts, tests/payment.test.ts, plus M2 refund handler + lib + test) and `VANILLA_EXISTING_ADOPTION_SESSION` (M1 README upgrade + M2 refund handler/lib/test on the sample-existing-ts fixture). `applyFileSet(cwd, fileSet)` writes the map into a tmpdir. Vanilla code is production-quality (proper directory split, executable handlers, real test cases) so the comparison stays fair
- `tests/scenarios/ab/_report.ts` (new module) — `renderCaseReport({caseTitle, intent, description, hypothesisFocus, m1A, m1B, m2A, m2B})` returns deterministic markdown: side-by-side M1+M2 metric tables with Δ column, detector outcome block, 6-bullet Findings narrative, How-to-reproduce section. `writeOrAssertReport(absPath, generated)` reads `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS` env var — when `1` (re)writes the file, otherwise asserts the on-disk content matches generated, emitting first-diff context on mismatch. Standard committed-snapshot pattern
- `tests/scenarios/ab/case-payment-saas.test.ts` — case 1 driver: empty tmpdir + "결제 SaaS for B2B" intent. Group A runs `runInit` with `GREENFIELD_S1_RESPONSE` mock at M1, hand-authors `F-4db939` refund shard + executable refund.ts + test at M2. Group B applies `VANILLA_PAYMENT_SAAS_SESSION.m1Files` then `.m2Files`. Renders to `docs/ab-evaluation/case-payment-saas.md`
- `tests/scenarios/ab/case-existing-adoption.test.ts` — case 2 driver: `sample-existing-ts` fixture (8 source files) + adoption intent. Group A uses `EXISTING_S2_RESPONSE` mock, M2 binds refund shard to existing `api` capability via `features:[F-4db939]`. Group B updates README at M1 then writes refund handler/lib/test at M2. Renders to `docs/ab-evaluation/case-existing-adoption.md`
- `docs/ab-evaluation/README.md` (new) — methodology: 5-step test loop, 8 metric dimensions table, determinism guarantees (refresh via `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1`), 4 explicit limitations (simulated-not-live-run, spec-gated-detectors silently pass on vanilla, chars/4 heuristic, only 2 cases × 2 milestones), reading guide
- `docs/ab-evaluation/case-payment-saas.md` (new, auto-generated) — greenfield case study. At M2 cladding produces 9 tier-banner-bearing artifacts vs vanilla's 0; 2 features / 3 ACs / 2 scenarios / 3 capabilities / 3 layers / 2 forbidden-import rules vs 0 of each; ~1680 vs ~1399 est. tokens (+281 token premium for structure)
- `docs/ab-evaluation/case-existing-adoption.md` (new, auto-generated) — adoption case study. At M2 cladding produces 8 tier-banner-bearing artifacts; ~3073 vs ~1280 est. tokens (+1793 premium when wrapping existing 113 LoC into the inventory)
- `docs/ab-evaluation/summary.md` (new) — cross-case verdict per hypothesis (H1 H2 H3 ✅ strongly supported; H4 ⚠️ partially supported with major caveat about spec-gated detectors; H5 ✅ supported with measured trade-off), cross-case observations (cladding front-loads spec / vanilla front-loads code), future work table

### Notes

- 877 + **2 new A/B case tests** = **879/879 passing**; lint clean; typecheck clean; build:plugin clean
- A/B test runtime: ~5.2s combined; total `npm test` runtime: ~7.5s (was ~2.4s, +5s for A/B suite)
- Reports are **byte-deterministic** — re-running without `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1` must match the committed files. CI mode = assert; local refresh = `UPDATE_AB_REPORTS=1 npx vitest run tests/scenarios/ab/`
- The framework intentionally surfaces a **limitation of the detector suite**: spec-gated detectors (`REFERENCE_INTEGRITY`, `MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION`, `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC`, `CAPABILITIES_FEATURE_MAPPING`, etc.) silently pass on vanilla because they have nothing to evaluate. The "0 errors on vanilla" is therefore *absence of signal*, not absence of drift. Tracked as roadmap item for a future `ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE` detector
- Vanilla simulator is **hand-curated**, not live-run — bias risk is acknowledged in `docs/ab-evaluation/README.md` §Limitations. The vanilla file sets are written at senior-quality so cladding's value doesn't depend on vanilla being underwritten; readers are invited to inspect `_vanilla-sim.ts` and judge fairness

### Roadmap

- Live-run mode: spawn real Claude Code sessions for Group B, capture transcripts, replay deterministically. Removes simulator bias
- M3 milestone: extend each case to 3-feature cumulative state. Show whether cladding's drift-prevention effect compounds over time
- `ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE` detector: convert vanilla's "0 errors silently pass" into actionable signal so cladding can flag trees missing its scaffold
- Third case (non-payment domain — image-processing API, marketing site, or ML pipeline) for domain-diversity sanity check
- Tokenizer swap: replace `chars / 4` heuristic with `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` once billing-class accuracy is needed

## [0.3.46] — 2026-05-21 — SSoT 4-tier lifecycle verification + token efficiency budgets (F-4747ef)

**The governance shipped in F-d12edf gets a test surface.** Two end-to-end lifecycle tests walk through 6 stages each (greenfield + existing-adoption), asserting that every Tier A/B/C/D artifact lands with the standard Tier banner, that cross-tier detectors emit zero errors, and — critically — that persona prompts + LLM dispatcher prompts + generated artifacts all stay within size budgets. The token-efficiency promise of the SSoT model is now auditable per-PR, not just claimed in design docs.

### Added

- `tests/scenarios/_token-meter.ts` (new module) — portable `measureFile` / `measureText` / `measurePersonaPrompt` / `measureLLMPrompt` returning `{lines, chars, estTokens}`. `estTokens` uses the `chars / 4` heuristic so no extra npm dependency is needed; the tokenizer migration path to `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` is documented in `docs/ssot-testing.md`
- `tests/scenarios/_size-budgets.ts` (new module) — `PERSONA_BUDGETS` (5 personas with per-file `maxLines`/`maxChars`/`maxTokens`), `META_DOC_BUDGETS` (`docs/ssot-model.md`), `LLM_PROMPT_BUDGETS` (`onboardingMaxTokens` + linear `refinementBaseMaxTokens` + `refinementPerQaPairMaxTokens`), `ARTIFACT_BUDGETS` (each Tier B/C body + scenario shards + onboarding state). Each budget calibrated from current baseline + 20-25% headroom; `checkBudget` + `refinementPromptBudget` + `onboardingPromptBudget` helpers compose into lifecycle assertions
- `tests/scenarios/_helpers.ts` (new module) — `mkScenarioCwd` (tmpdir + cleanup), `copyFixture` (fixture → tmpdir), `writeUnderCwd`, plus three realistic LLM-mocked response constants (`GREENFIELD_S1_RESPONSE`, `GREENFIELD_S2_RESPONSE`, `GREENFIELD_S5_RESPONSE`, `EXISTING_S2_RESPONSE`) that look like real senior-architect-tone dispatcher output
- `tests/scenarios/_assertions.ts` (new module) — high-level assertions: `assertTierBanner` (first-line tier marker), `assertArtifactsPresent` (per-stage expectation map), `assertCrossTierClean` (runs all 25 detectors with `allowedDetectors` escape hatch for cladding-self checks like META_INTEGRITY/HARDCODED_SECRET that don't apply to tmpdir fixtures), `assertSpecCompleteness` (capability + scenario count floors), `assertProposalDivert` (re-write divert mechanism fired), `buildSizeDigest` + `formatDigest` + `assertNoBudgetOverages` (final-stage budget gate that prints to stdout on pass/fail)
- `tests/scenarios/_fixtures/sample-existing-ts/` (new fixture) — realistic 8-source-file TypeScript project: `package.json`, `README.md` (Install/Usage/API sections), `src/api/` (index/health/auth), `src/lib/` (payment/ledger), `src/util/` (log/uuid), `tests/payment.test.ts`. File count crosses `SCAN_AUTO_THRESHOLD = 3` so the existing-adoption path takes the observed scan branch
- `tests/scenarios/greenfield-lifecycle.test.ts` — 5 tests covering 6 stages (S1 init with intent, S2 refine, S3 simulate code, S4 strict check, S5 re-scan, S6 final digest). Mock-dispatcher pattern follows `tests/cli/refine.test.ts`: `vi.mock` registers a shared `vi.fn` at module load, each stage queues its response via `mockResolvedValueOnce`
- `tests/scenarios/existing-adoption-lifecycle.test.ts` — 6 tests covering 6 stages on the populated fixture (S1 seed, S2 init with adoption intent, S3 refine, S4 hand-author new feature, S5 bind feature to capability, S6 final digest)
- `docs/ssot-testing.md` (new policy doc) — 4-tier verification methodology + token measurement + ratchet pattern (bump budget in PR review before merging growth) + tokenizer migration path

### Changed

- `src/cli/scan/intent-onboarding.ts` — new `ensureTierBBannerYaml(body)` helper prepends the standard Tier B banner to LLM-emitted `capabilities.yaml` / `architecture.yaml` bodies when missing. `interpretOnboardingWithFallback` + `interpretRefinementWithFallback` both call it so every artifact's first line is banner-compliant regardless of which path (greenfield seed / LLM response / deterministic fallback) produced it. The lifecycle test for greenfield S1 surfaced the gap — LLM dispatchers don't naturally emit cladding's Tier banner, so the post-processor closes the loop

### Notes

- 865 + **12 new lifecycle tests** = **877/877 passing**; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Lifecycle test runtime: ~1.4s for both files combined (well within budget)
- Total `npm test` runtime: ~2.4s (was ~1.6s, +0.8s for lifecycle suite)
- Token efficiency digest is printed to stdout at every S6 end — auditable on pass, fails the test on overage. Sample output in `docs/ssot-testing.md`
- The lifecycle tests caught a real production gap: LLM-emitted YAML bodies were missing the Tier banner. Fixed by `ensureTierBBannerYaml`. AC-008 documents this discovery

### Roadmap

- Migrate `estTokens` to `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` once exact token counts are needed (one-line swap per `docs/ssot-testing.md`)
- Add a third lifecycle case for the `clad serve` MCP-host path once that surface stabilizes
- `ARTIFACT_HEADER_STALE` detector — now that the banner convention has a test surface, the detector that enforces it (planned in F-d12edf roadmap) becomes safer to ship

---

## [0.3.45] — 2026-05-21 — SSoT 4-tier governance + Tier B/A orphan resolution (F-d12edf)

**Every artifact gets a clear role.** Through v0.3.41–v0.3.44 the init/scan/refine pipeline grew six new artifacts (`spec/architecture.yaml`, `spec/capabilities.yaml`, `docs/project-context.md`, `docs/conventions.md` seed, `.cladding/onboarding/state.yaml`, scenarios). Without a single governance doc three problems emerged: personas repeated tier policy in their own prompts (token waste); `spec/capabilities.yaml` was orphan (no consumer); `spec/scenarios/*.yaml`'s `flow` field had no producer or consumer. v0.3.45 fixes all three.

### Added

- `docs/ssot-model.md` — single governance document defining the 4 tiers (A Spec SSoT · B Design SSoT · C Derived · D Audit/Transient), per-artifact (tier, producer, consumer, refresh trigger) registry, header convention, directory policy, persona reading map, cross-document consistency rules
- `spec/README.md` — gains a Tier index paragraph mapping spec/ contents (Tier A: spec.yaml/features/scenarios; Tier B: architecture/capabilities)
- `docs/README.md` (new) — Tier index for docs/ contents (Tier B: project-context, multi-provider-roadmap, spec-ids-multi-dev, ux-routing-coverage; Tier C: conventions, code-style; Tier D: benchmarks, dogfood)
- `src/cli/scan/intent-onboarding.ts` — 7th sentinel `=== SCENARIOS_YAML ===` in both `buildOnboardingPrompt` and `buildRefinementPrompt`; LLM extracts 1-3 user-journey scenarios from intent + project-context prose (NOT architecture layers); `OnboardingResult.scenarios` populated; `extractScenarios` parser with deterministic `S-<hash6>` id from slug (FNV-1a)
- `src/cli/init.ts` — writes onboarding scenarios as Tier A shards under `spec/scenarios/<slug>-<hash6>.yaml` via `renderScenarioYaml`; existing files divert to `.cladding/scan/<basename>.proposal`
- `src/cli/refine.ts` — refresh path writes refined scenarios alongside other artifacts
- `src/stages/detectors/capabilities-feature-mapping.ts` (new detector) — validates `spec/capabilities.yaml` against `spec.yaml` features: error on dangling feature id, warn on orphan capability (`features: []` or missing), info on feature without capability mapping. Registered in `src/stages/detectors/index.ts` (24 → 25 detectors)
- 9 new tests in `tests/stages/capabilities-feature-mapping.test.ts` covering missing file, empty array, clean mapping, dangling id, orphan capability, missing features field, unmapped feature, mixed findings, malformed YAML

### Changed

- Artifact renderer headers standardized to the Tier banner format `<!-- Cladding · Tier <X> · <authority> · Refreshed by: <verb> -->` (or `# Cladding · Tier <X> · ...` for YAML): `greenfield-seeds.ts` (3 seeds), `intent-onboarding.ts` (ONBOARDING + DETERMINISTIC headers), `llm.ts` (observed conventions/architecture/capabilities + project-context refined + observed), `init.ts` (spec.yaml seed), `onboarding-state.ts` (state.yaml). Personas + tools can identify tier from `head -1` without loading the body
- 5 persona prompts (`src/agents/*.md`) reshape their Sources sections around the 4-tier model and link to `docs/ssot-model.md` instead of repeating policy: `orchestrator` reads B + D + A-slice; `librarian` reads A (write) + B (cross-validate); `specialists` reads B + C + A-slice; `reviewer` reads A + B + C + D with tier conflict-resolution rule (A wins); `observability` reads D only
- `src/agents/README.md` PERSONAS table reshapes the `reads` column to name the tier slice each persona consumes
- `src/agents/librarian.md` — Scenarios policy reflects v0.3.45 onboarding: scenarios are onboarding output (init/refine produce), librarian binds features via `features[]` array (not the primary author)
- `skills/init/SKILL.md` + `skills/refine/SKILL.md` — Artifacts produced section restructured by tier; link to `docs/ssot-model.md`
- Test header assertions migrate from `Auto-generated by ...` pattern to the new Tier banner pattern: `tests/cli/scan-greenfield-seeds.test.ts`, `tests/cli/scan-llm.test.ts`, `tests/cli/init.test.ts`

### Notes

- 856 + 9 new tests = **865/865** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Detector count: 24 → **25** (auto-recounted by `npm run build:plugin` into `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)
- Directory policy: kept current paths (`spec/`, `docs/`, `.cladding/`) — directories encode domain, tier is metadata via the header banner. Tier-named directories (`tier-a/`, `tier-b/`) were considered and rejected: ~1500 LOC of detector path rewrites + breaks upstream Ironclad standard + every external project would need migration; benefit (path-encoded tier) is already provided by the banner
- Tier B entry condition (strict): every Tier B artifact must have at least one named consumer. This cycle resolves the v0.3.45 orphans — `capabilities.yaml` gains the new detector, `project-context.md` becomes the scenario-generator source, `scenarios/*.yaml`'s `flow` gains a producer (onboarding) and a binding consumer (`clad_create_feature`)
- Token efficiency: persona prompts shed ~30-40 lines each by referencing `ssot-model.md` instead of repeating policy. Meta-doc is read once per session; downstream invocations save ~150-300 tokens per persona call

### Roadmap

- `ARTIFACT_HEADER_STALE` detector — enforce the new banner convention (next cycle)
- `SCENARIO_COVERAGE` detector — verify each scenario's `features[]` adequately cover its `flow` (next cycle)
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT_DRIFT` detector — verify project-context.md aligns with capabilities + architecture (next cycle)
- `ORPHAN_FIXTURE` detector — flag registered fixtures with zero citations (next cycle)
- `docs/code-style.md` deprecation processing — superseded by `docs/conventions.md`

## [0.3.44] — 2026-05-21 — `clad refine` verb closes the onboarding Q&A loop (F-09d68b)

**Seed becomes sapling.** v0.3.43 added intent-aware init that produced clarifying questions as CLI hints — but the questions were unconsumed. v0.3.44 closes the loop with `clad refine <answer>`: the orchestrator persona asks each pending question, forwards the user's reply, and the LLM refines `docs/project-context.md` + `spec/capabilities.yaml` + `spec/architecture.yaml` based on the full Q-A history. State persists in `.cladding/onboarding/state.yaml`; `status: done` lands when every question is answered AND no new ones emerge.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/onboarding-state.ts` (new module) — `.cladding/onboarding/state.yaml` reader/writer plus helpers `loadState` / `saveState` / `firstPendingIndex` / `markFirstPendingAnswered` / `appendNewQuestions` / `isComplete` / `markDone`; state shape carries `{intent, language, projectName, mode, startedAt, status, qa: [{question, answer|null}]}` and `loadState` normalises hand-edited mode/answer values defensively
- `src/cli/scan/intent-onboarding.ts` — new `buildRefinementPrompt(intent, observed, qaHistory, current)` that reuses the 6-sentinel layout but embeds the full Q-A history plus current artifact bodies inside fenced code blocks so the LLM refines accurately; new `interpretRefinementWithFallback(intent, observed, qaHistory, current, dispatcher, cwd?)` that mirrors the init path's fallback policy and emits `sentinel_miss` events under `phase: 'onboarding'`; new `deterministicRefinement` that preserves current artifact bodies and appends the latest Q-A pair as a footnote under a "## Q&A log (refinement, LLM unavailable)" heading in `docs/project-context.md`
- `src/cli/refine.ts` (new module) — `runRefineCommand(answerTokens, opts)` handler: loads state, marks the first pending question answered, calls the LLM with full Q-A history, writes refined artifacts via inlined `writeArtifact` divert, appends new questions, marks `status: done` when finished
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — registers `refine [answer...]` (12 verbs now) with `--cwd` / `--no-llm` / `--json` flags
- `src/cli/init.ts` — when the intent-aware onboarding path runs, persists the initial state via `saveState(cwd, {intent, language, projectName, mode, startedAt: ISO, status: 'active'|'done', qa: clarifyingQuestions.map(q => ({question: q, answer: null}))})` so `clad refine` has a starting point
- `src/agents/orchestrator.md` — principle 6 expands from a single Init policy into two steps: 6a (init with intent) + 6b (refine loop — read state, ask first pending question verbatim, run `clad refine` with reply, repeat until `status: done`); never invent answers, never rephrase the LLM's calibrated questions
- `skills/refine/SKILL.md` (new) — documents the flow + variadic positional CLI shape + state.yaml schema + exit codes (0 accepted, 1 fatal, 2 usage) + when NOT to invoke
- 26 new tests: `tests/cli/onboarding-state.test.ts` (16 — save/load round-trip, hand-edited normalisation, Unicode intent preservation, firstPendingIndex / markFirstPendingAnswered / appendNewQuestions de-dup / isComplete / markDone helpers) + `tests/cli/refine.test.ts` (10 — no state → exit 2, no answer → exit 2, status done → no-op, deterministic mode preserves artifacts + appends footnote, LLM success refines + adds questions, completion marks done, `--json` emits RefineReport)

### Changed

- `tests/cli/clad.test.ts` createProgram registry assertion grows from "11 verbs" to "12 verbs" — `refine` joins the canonical CLI surface

### Notes

- 830 + 26 new tests = **856/856** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- The Q-A loop is **strictly LLM-driven**: only the LLM emits questions; the orchestrator persona MUST forward them verbatim, never invent extras. Answers refine artifacts; no answer is rephrased by the orchestrator before forwarding
- `clad refine --no-llm` keeps the deterministic fallback: current artifact bodies are preserved and the answer lands as a Q&A footnote in `docs/project-context.md` so user intent is captured even without LLM connectivity
- `.cladding/onboarding/state.yaml` stays on disk after `status: done` as an audit log of the onboarding decisions; the file is not deleted automatically
- `sentinel_miss` telemetry uses the existing `phase: 'onboarding'` value — `clad doctor` now surfaces both init-pass and refine-pass misses under one phase

### Roadmap

- Future surface: MCP onboarding resource (`cladding://onboarding/next-question`) so MCP clients can subscribe and live-tail the Q&A state instead of reading the file
- Release window — four unreleased cycles queued post-v0.3.40 (v0.3.41 doc cleanup + v0.3.42 greenfield seeds + v0.3.43 intent-aware init + v0.3.44 refine loop); release timing is the maintainer's call

---

## [0.3.43] — 2026-05-21 — intent-aware init with high-quality onboarding refinement (F-56abaa)

**Init becomes the observation phase.** Previous cycles made `clad init` write toolchain-default seeds on greenfield. This cycle makes init capture the **user's project intent** as a positional argument and turn it into domain-aware artifacts that **exceed what the user explicitly stated**. `clad init 결제 SaaS for B2B` produces a project-context body, capabilities list, architecture layers, F-001 title, and 2-3 product-level follow-up questions — all calibrated for the payment domain. The LLM is told to ask GOAL/AUDIENCE/SCOPE questions (e.g., "주 사용자가 개인? 사업자?") not technical jargon (e.g., never "PCI-DSS SAQ?"). The orchestrator persona now MUST ask the user for intent before bare `clad init` on a greenfield workspace.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/intent-onboarding.ts` (new module) — senior-architect-tone LLM prompt builder with 6 sentinel sections (`ONBOARDING_MODE`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT_MD`, `CAPABILITIES_YAML`, `ARCHITECTURE_YAML`, `SPEC_SEED_TITLE`, `CLARIFYING_QUESTIONS`); response parser; clarifying-question extractor that accepts bullets/numbers/raw lines and caps at 5; `interpretOnboardingWithFallback(intent, observed, dispatcher, cwd?)` orchestrates the call with deterministic fallback and emits `sentinel_miss` events under a new `phase: 'onboarding'` value
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `InitOptions.intent?: string` field; when present the onboarding pass runs before `spec.yaml` write so the F-001 title is intent-derived and the greenfield seed bodies for capabilities + architecture + project-context get replaced by the LLM-refined bodies; `conventions.md` stays toolchain-default because conventions are language-specific
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — `init [intent...]` variadic positional (no `--intent` keyword needed, no quotes required); joins tokens with space; `runInitCommand` accepts the new positional and forwards as `intent`
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — clarifying-question CLI hint: when the onboarding pass returns 1-5 questions they print as a numbered list under "💡 다음 정보가 있으면 더 정확한 스펙이 됩니다:"
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — greenfield + no-intent hint: when `clad init` is run bare on a greenfield workspace via direct CLI, the handler prints a "💡 Tip" suggesting `clad init <description>` for higher quality
- `src/agents/orchestrator.md` — 6th invocation principle "Init policy (의무)" declares the orchestrator MUST ask the user for intent before bare `clad init` on a greenfield workspace and forwards the answer as the positional argument; bare `clad init` on existing projects stays valid (observed scan path)
- 32 new tests: 18 in `tests/cli/intent-onboarding.test.ts` (prompt shape, six-sentinel parser, mode normalisation, question extraction with bullet/number/raw shapes, deterministic fallback variants, `interpretOnboardingWithFallback` LLM-success / per-artifact fallback / total fallback / no-cwd paths) + 1 in `tests/cli/clad.test.ts` (variadic positional joins into intent + clarifying-questions hint renders) + 13 indirect via updated `runInitCommand` signatures

### Changed

- `skills/init/SKILL.md` — adds an "Intent-aware onboarding (v0.3.43+)" section that opens the doc; documents the positional intent path with no-quote examples; clarifies that AI orchestrators MUST ask before bare init on greenfield (per orchestrator principle 6); examples block now leads with intent-driven invocations
- `tests/cli/clad.test.ts` — `runInitCommand` signature is now `(intentTokens, opts)`; three existing tests updated to pass `undefined` as the first argument; `expect(runInitMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...)` gains `intent: undefined` + explicit `roots: undefined` entries

### Notes

- 798 + 32 new tests = **830/830** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- `--scan` flag stays — orthogonal to positional intent. `clad init 결제 SaaS --scan` combines the two signals
- `--no-llm` keeps deterministic fallback path; intent text still routes but lands as a verbatim quote in `project-context.md`
- LLM prompt design explicitly bans expert jargon questions: BAD examples like "PCI-DSS SAQ?" / "Webhook idempotency single-flight vs distributed lock?" / "SSR vs SSG vs ISR?" are listed alongside GOOD product-level examples ("주 사용자가 개인? 사업자?", "한국 시장? 글로벌?", "실시간 결과 vs 배치 OK?"). The user does NOT need to know technical jargon to answer
- `sentinel_miss` telemetry gains `phase: 'onboarding'` — `clad doctor` now surfaces onboarding misses alongside scan + project-context misses
- Deterministic mode emits no clarifying questions (their calibration depends on the LLM); the CLI hint suggesting `clad init <description>` only fires on bare greenfield init, not on the deterministic fallback path

### Roadmap

- Next cycle: Q&A iteration loop. The clarifying questions returned by init are currently CLI hints only — orchestrator persona should consume them and run a follow-up `clad_refine` (MCP tool or `clad refine` verb) that takes a user answer and updates spec/docs incrementally
- Release window — three unreleased cycles queued post-v0.3.40 (`v0.3.41` doc cleanup + `v0.3.42` greenfield seeds + `v0.3.43` intent-aware init); release timing is the maintainer's call

---

## [0.3.42] — 2026-05-21 — greenfield seeds for scan-derived artifacts (F-bd07d7)

**Half-finished workspaces become whole.** Before v0.3.42, `clad init` on a brand-new project (no code yet) wrote `spec.yaml` + `docs/project-context.md` template + `spec/scenarios/README.md` but **skipped** `docs/conventions.md` / `spec/architecture.yaml` / `spec/capabilities.yaml` because the auto-scan threshold (≥3 source files) was not met. Personas downstream had to carry an "if absent" branch in their guidance. This cycle closes the gap by writing all three artifacts as **toolchain-default seeds** at init time — TypeScript / Python / Go / Rust / Ruby / Java each get idiomatic defaults — and the existing `writeArtifact` divert mechanism replaces them with observed bodies on a later `clad init --scan` (the new bodies land in `.cladding/scan/*.proposal` for review).

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/greenfield-seeds.ts` (new module) — three pure renderers: `renderGreenfieldConventionsMd(language, projectName)` produces the SEED-marked 14-signal table with the canonical style-guide URL inline (Google TypeScript Style / PEP 8 / Effective Go / Google Java Style / Rust Style / Ruby Style); `renderGreenfieldArchitectureYaml(language)` returns `version: "0.1"` + empty `layers: []` + a per-language directory baseline in the header comment (TS → `src/cli/`/`src/core/`/`src/lib/`/`src/ui/`, Python → `src/<package>/`/`tests/`, Go → `cmd/`/`pkg/`/`internal/`, Rust → `src/lib.rs`/`src/main.rs`/`src/bin/`/`tests/`, Ruby → `lib/<gem>/`/`spec/`, Java → `src/main/java/<package>/`/`src/test/java/<package>/`); `renderGreenfieldCapabilitiesYaml(projectName)` returns `schema: "0.1"` + `source: README.md` + empty `capabilities: []` + per-entry shape documentation
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `runInit` grows an `else`-branch on the `shouldWriteScanArtifacts` conditional that writes the three seeds plus the unchanged `spec/scenarios/README.md` via the existing `writeArtifact` helper; the spec/docs surface is now always complete after `clad init`, regardless of whether observed signals exist
- 19 new tests: `tests/cli/scan-greenfield-seeds.test.ts` (16 — 7 language defaults · 14-signal completeness · unknown-language fallback · re-scan instruction presence · projectName interpolation · capabilities-seed determinism) + `tests/cli/init.test.ts` (2 — greenfield TS default, Python-detected switch)

### Changed

- `src/agents/specialists.md` "Code policy" collapses from "conventions.md may or may not exist" two-state guidance to single-state "follow `docs/conventions.md`" since `clad init` now always writes it; the body explains the SEED-vs-observed mode marker so the persona can act on the same surface in both modes
- `src/agents/librarian.md` "What you do" gains a bullet declaring `spec/architecture.yaml` + `spec/capabilities.yaml` always-present (seeded by `clad init`, refined by `clad init --scan`); hand edits stay in the live file while the next scan diverts the observed body to `.cladding/scan/*.proposal`
- `skills/init/SKILL.md` gains a "Greenfield seeds (v0.3.42+)" subsection naming the three seeds and the per-language defaults so adopters can predict the body shape before running the verb

### Notes

- 779 + 19 new tests = **798/798** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; `clad sync`: 116 features valid (was 115)
- Detector count stays 24/24 — this cycle did not add a detector
- Per-language Conventions defaults live in the same `Conventions` shape as the observed table so seed vs observed bodies share one downstream reader path
- Unknown languages (or `detectToolchain` returning `unknown`) fall back to TypeScript defaults, mirroring the existing `manifestLanguage` fallback in `runInit`
- The seed body for `spec/architecture.yaml` keeps `layers: []` empty intentionally so the user has to opt in to declarations; the header comment lists the suggested layout the maintainer can copy

### Roadmap

- Release window — two unreleased cycles queued post-v0.3.40 (`v0.3.41` doc cleanup + `v0.3.42` greenfield seeds); release timing is the maintainer's call

## [0.3.41] — 2026-05-21 — persona + skill md drift cleanup (F-40327b)

**Docs catch up to v0.3.40.** Multi-cycle persona/skill drift had piled up: `specialists` still pointed at `docs/code-style.md` (the cladding-self guide) when its consumer-facing target is `docs/conventions.md` (auto-generated by `clad init --scan`); `librarian` and `orchestrator` still spoke `F-NNN` sequential ids when v0.3.9 mandated `F-<hash6>` for new features; `observability` had no awareness of `.cladding/events.log.jsonl`, the v0.3.39 `sentinel_miss` event, or the v0.3.40 `clad doctor` consumer; five verbs (`doctor`, `checkpoint`, `rollback`, `route`, `work`) had no canonical SKILL.md so the plugin manifests carried zero guidance for them; every persona referenced `ironclad-design/03-ux-routing.md §1.2` when that directory does not exist in cladding's repo. This cycle realigns the canonical sources with v0.3.40 reality and regenerates the auto-mirrored manifests.

### Changed

- `src/agents/specialists.md` — `docs/code-style.md` → `docs/conventions.md` (consumer-facing auto-generated artifact) with a fallback note for cladding-self contributors; F-NNN reference becomes `F-NNN` / `F-<hash6>`
- `src/agents/librarian.md` — F-NNN expanded to explicit hash-based guidance for new features (`F-<hash6>` since v0.3.9; legacy F-NNN stays sequential — never migrate); new "Scenarios policy (v0.3.30+)" subsection documents the auto-extraction deprecation
- `src/agents/orchestrator.md` — routing table grows an "is my LLM host healthy?" / "why did the scan fall back to deterministic?" row pointing at observability via `clad doctor`; `F-049` example → `F-a3f9c2`-shaped hash
- `src/agents/reviewer.md` — frontmatter description drops the `ironclad-design/13` path; guardrails-table header drops the `(per ironclad-design/13-philosophical-guardrails.md)` cross-link because the table already inlines every guardrail
- `src/agents/observability.md` — Sources table gains `.cladding/events.log.jsonl` (lifecycle transitions including `sentinel_miss`); Reports list gains a "Sentinel-miss summary" entry pointing at `clad doctor` and the `DoctorReport` JSON wire format
- `src/agents/README.md` — `[CLAIM]` becomes self-contained instead of referencing the missing `ironclad-design/14`; `[TBD]` items that already landed (`CONVENTION_DRIFT` + `UNTESTED_AC` detectors) move into a new `[DONE_SINCE_T9]` section; the stale "folded into commands/work.md in v0.1" claim becomes an accurate description of the current `commands/clad.md` + per-verb `skills/<verb>/SKILL.md` layout
- All five personas drop the trailing "See `ironclad-design/03-ux-routing.md` §1.2" cross-link — the inline guidance already names the `src/ui/softShell.ts` helpers so no behavioural advice is lost
- `skills/init/SKILL.md` — `--scan` / `--no-llm` / `--roots` flag docs added; scan-artifact list (`docs/conventions.md`, `spec/architecture.yaml`, `spec/capabilities.yaml`, `docs/project-context.md`, `spec/scenarios/README.md`) added; hash-based id guidance + a one-liner generator command added
- `skills/drive/SKILL.md` — `--cwd <path>` flag added; post-drive `clad doctor` cross-reference added
- `skills/panel/SKILL.md` — rows description disambiguates legacy `F-NNN` from `F-<hash6>` (v0.3.9+)
- `skills/check/SKILL.md` — Drift stage description notes that the gate runs every active detector under `src/stages/detectors/` (24/24 as of v0.3.40) and that `npm run build:plugin` auto-recounts

### Added

- `skills/doctor/SKILL.md` — canonical surface for the v0.3.40 LLM-dispatcher health-check verb: `--cwd` + `--json`, the `DoctorReport` wire format, formatted-text sections (event-type breakdown · phase × cause × fallback · top-missed · recent errors · tuning hint), exit-code contract, when-to-run list
- `skills/checkpoint/SKILL.md` — Iron Law backbone Phase 1 (iron-law.md §2.5): payload shape (`featureId` / `gitHead` / `specDigest` / `timestamp`), explicit no-mutation contract, when-to-use list, pairing with rollback
- `skills/rollback/SKILL.md` — partner verb: `--reason` flag, exit-code matrix, the deliberate do-not-checkout policy, pairing with checkpoint
- `skills/route/SKILL.md` — natural-language → verb classifier: read-only no-workspace contract, conservative `unknown` fallback exits 1, debugging-tool framing
- `skills/work/SKILL.md` — documents the current stub behaviour and reserves the verb for the future intent-routing entry point so plugin manifests carry the placeholder without surprise

### Regenerated (auto by `npm run build:plugin`)

- `agents/*.md` — 5 personas re-copied from `src/agents/*.md`
- `plugins/codex/skills/<persona>/SKILL.md` + `plugins/codex/skills/<verb>/SKILL.md` — 5 personas + 11 verbs (was 6) re-copied
- `plugins/gemini-cli/commands/<verb>.toml` — 11 verbs (was 6) re-transpiled

### Notes

- 779/779 tests passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; `clad sync`: 115 features valid (was 114)
- Manifest-detectors integer stays 24/24 — this cycle did not add a detector
- Zero source-code change — pure documentation + manifest cleanup. No drift baseline shift
- Manual greps post-edit: `ironclad-design` / `docs/code-style` / `F-049` across `src/agents/` + `skills/` all return zero matches

### Roadmap

- Release window — two unreleased cycles queued post-v0.3.40 (`v0.3.41` doc cleanup + whatever lands next); release timing is the maintainer's call

## [0.3.40] — 2026-05-20 — `clad doctor` verb consumes sentinel-miss telemetry (F-bb15e6)

**Signals find their consumer.** v0.3.39 (F-65814a) made every LLM dispatcher fallback observable by emitting a `sentinel_miss` event to `.cladding/events.log.jsonl`. Reading that log meant `grep sentinel_miss .cladding/events.log.jsonl | jq …` recipes by hand. v0.3.40 closes the loop with `clad doctor` — a one-shot health summary that groups misses by phase × cause × fallback, lists the top-5 most-missed sentinels, and replays the last three unique dispatcher errors. `--json` ships the same data as a stable `DoctorReport` shape for MCP clients and follow-up tooling.

### Added

- `src/core/telemetry-summary.ts` (new module) — pure aggregation library. `summarizeSentinelMisses(events)` groups by `payload.phase` / `payload.cause` / `payload.fallback`, returns a desc-count + asc-name top-5 histogram of `payload.missed_sections`, and de-duplicates the last 3 `payload.error` strings newest-first. `summarizeEvents(events)` returns total + per-`EventType` counts over the whole slice. Side-effect free — the same helpers can power a future MCP doctor resource without changes
- `src/cli/doctor.ts` (new module) — `runDoctorCommand({cwd?, json?})` reads `<cwd>/.cladding/events.log.jsonl` via `readEvents`, runs both aggregators, emits one `pulse` summary line (`pass` when zero misses, `note` otherwise), and prints the event-type breakdown plus the phase / cause / fallback table, top-missed sentinels list, recent dispatcher errors, and a tuning hint when sentinel-miss events exist
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — `createProgram` registers the new `doctor` command after `serve`: `.option('--cwd <path>')`, `.option('--json')`; commander auto-generates `--help` from the description
- 16 new tests: `tests/core/telemetry-summary.test.ts` (zero state, type-filter, phase/cause/fallback aggregation, tie-break + cap of top-missed, recent-errors de-dup + newest-first, malformed payload tolerance, event-type counter); `tests/cli/doctor.test.ts` (greenfield no-events, healthy host, unhealthy host with breakdown + top-missed + recent errors, `--json` shape on populated + greenfield, corrupt `events.log.jsonl` → exit 1)

### Changed

- `tests/cli/clad.test.ts` `createProgram` registry assertion grows from "10 verbs" to "11 verbs" — the additive verb registration is a contract change in the test surface, intentional and confirms wiring

### Notes

- 764 + 15 new tests = **779/779** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; sync: 114 features valid
- The `DoctorReport` shape (`{cwd, events, sentinelMiss}`) is now the stable wire format for `clad doctor --json`; new fields will be additive
- Greenfield workspaces (no `events.log.jsonl`) exit 0 with a friendly note instead of a stack trace — adopters who have not exercised cladding yet see the same exit semantics as a healthy host
- Corrupt `events.log.jsonl` (unparseable JSONL) is the only non-zero exit path; CI consumers can rely on `clad doctor` for telemetry sanity without learning a separate failure surface

### Roadmap

- Release window — three unreleased cycles queued post-v0.3.37 (`v0.3.38` capabilities + `v0.3.39` telemetry + `v0.3.40` doctor); release timing is the maintainer's call. v0.3.40 closes the LLM-refinement arc (`signal → consumer`), so this is a natural cut point
- Future doctor surfaces: an MCP resource (`cladding://doctor/sentinel-miss`) backed by the same `summarizeSentinelMisses` reducer; a histogram-over-time mode for tracking miss rate across sampling-policy changes

---

## [0.3.39] — 2026-05-20 — sentinel-miss telemetry surfaces LLM fallbacks in events.log (F-65814a)

**Silent fallback gets a voice.** v0.3.33–v0.3.35 wired the LLM dispatcher chain plus per-artifact / total fallback behaviour for conventions, architecture, scenarios, project-context, and (v0.3.38) capabilities. Every fallback site was silent — a host whose sampling policy systematically dropped one sentinel would never know, and adopters had no data to tune model / `max_tokens` / temperature against. v0.3.39 makes the misses observable by emitting a structured `sentinel_miss` lifecycle event per fallback to `.cladding/events.log.jsonl`. Configured-no-LLM runs (no dispatcher, greenfield, `--no-llm`) stay silent because they are deliberate offline runs rather than misses.

### Added

- `src/events/log.ts` — `EventType` union grows a `'sentinel_miss'` arm with an inline payload schema (`phase: 'scan_artifacts' | 'project_context'` · `cause: 'blank_section' | 'dispatcher_error'` · `fallback: 'total' | 'per_artifact'` · `missed_sections?: string[]` · `error?: string`)
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `InterpretedScan` grows a `readonly missedSections: readonly string[]` field; `interpretWithLlm` populates it by inspecting `sections.{conventions,architecture,scenarios,capabilities}` for blank trims; `deterministicInterpret` leaves it `[]` because it never consumed an LLM reply
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `interpretScanWithFallback(scan, dispatcher, cwd?)` emits in three places: dispatcher throw (`cause: 'dispatcher_error'`, `fallback: 'total'`, truncated `error`); `CONVENTIONS_MD` or `ARCHITECTURE_YAML` blank (`cause: 'blank_section'`, `fallback: 'total'`, `missed_sections`); only non-critical sentinels blank (`cause: 'blank_section'`, `fallback: 'per_artifact'`, `missed_sections`)
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `renderProjectContextMdWithLlm(ctx, name, dispatcher, cwd?)` emits dispatcher-throw and `WHY` / `WHAT` / `PURPOSE` blank-section events with the same schema under `phase: 'project_context'`
- `src/cli/init.ts` — threads the existing `cwd` variable into both refinement helpers so production calls always reach the telemetry sink while unit tests that omit `cwd` stay silent
- 11 new tests covering each emit site, the configured-no-LLM negatives (no dispatcher, no cwd, greenfield), and the `missedSections` population contract

### Changed

- v0.3.38 entry's stale roadmap counter (`six unreleased capability cycles`) corrected — after PR #121 dated and shipped the v0.3.28–v0.3.37 batch, only the v0.3.38 capability cycle was unreleased; v0.3.39 makes that two unreleased cycles, not seven

### Notes

- 753 + 11 new tests = **764/764** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Telemetry never fails the init flow: `emitSentinelMiss` wraps `appendEvent` in a try/catch so a read-only workspace or transient fs error is swallowed — the artifacts already wrote successfully via `writeArtifact`
- `error` payload field is truncated to 200 characters so an oversized stack trace from a misbehaving dispatcher cannot bloat `events.log.jsonl`
- The configured-no-LLM majority of `clad init` invocations is byte-identical to v0.3.38 — no event written, no behavioural change

### Roadmap

- Release window — two unreleased cycles queued (`v0.3.38` capabilities + `v0.3.39` telemetry); release timing is the maintainer's call
- Future telemetry surfaces: a `clad doctor` verb that summarises `events.log.jsonl` (top missed sentinels, fallback frequency by phase) so adopters get a one-shot health check instead of grep recipes

## [0.3.38] — 2026-05-20 — spec/capabilities.yaml LLM extraction from README headings (F-d3bde4)

**README ## headings get a first-class spec mirror.** v0.3.32 surfaced README headings inside `docs/project-context.md`; v0.3.33–v0.3.35 layered LLM refinement on top of conventions, architecture, and project-context. v0.3.38 closes the loop by minting `spec/capabilities.yaml` — the README-derived capability inventory — as its own artifact so downstream detectors and dashboards can read the capability list without re-parsing markdown.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `renderCapabilitiesYaml(headings)` deterministic renderer. Schema `schema: "0.1"` / `source: README.md` / `capabilities: [{id, title}]`; slugifier lowercases, expands `&` → `and`, collapses non-alphanumerics to `-`, and falls back to `capability` when a heading slugifies to empty. Titles are double-quoted with embedded-quote escaping
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `buildPrompt` grows a fourth `=== CAPABILITIES_YAML ===` sentinel and packs `scan.projectContext?.readmeHeadings` into a labelled prompt block; LLM-refined runs add `summary` + `surface` (feature | platform | tool | infrastructure) per entry while the schema stays forward-compatible with the deterministic body
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `parseLlmResponse` returns the new `capabilities` section alongside conventions / architecture / scenarios; `InterpretedScan` grows a `capabilitiesYaml: string` field that both `interpretWithLlm` and `deterministicInterpret` populate
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `writeArtifact(cwd, 'spec/capabilities.yaml', interp.capabilitiesYaml, …)` lands directly after the `spec/architecture.yaml` write so the new artifact follows the same created-vs-`.cladding/scan/*.proposal` divert policy when the file already exists
- Per-artifact capabilities fallback: a dispatcher reply that parses but leaves the `CAPABILITIES_YAML` section blank keeps `mode === 'llm'` for conventions + architecture and substitutes `renderCapabilitiesYaml(headings)` for capabilities instead of triggering total fallback

### Changed

- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `renderProjectContextRefined` + `renderProjectContextObserved` swap the "`_Reviewer interprets as capabilities — refine into spec/capabilities.yaml once v0.4 lands._`" placeholder for "`_Mirrored into spec/capabilities.yaml; LLM-refined when a dispatcher is available._`"; the trailing **See also** block now lists the new artifact

### Notes

- 743 + new tests passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Deterministic path is byte-stable when `scan.projectContext` is `null` — projects without a README see `capabilities: []` and no other change
- The artifact is auxiliary: `clad sync` continues to load `spec.yaml` as the master and treats `spec/capabilities.yaml` like `spec/architecture.yaml` — present, but not required for the existing detector chain

### Roadmap

- v0.3.39+ — sentinel-miss telemetry surfacing in `events.log` so adopters can tune their host's sampling policy (capabilities fallback now joins conventions/architecture as a per-artifact telemetry source)
- Release window — one unreleased cycle queued post-v0.3.37 (this one); release timing is the maintainer's call

---

## [0.3.37] — 2026-05-20 — README capability headline catches up to develop (F-1c9166)

**Marketing surface had drifted.** Five unreleased cycles (v0.3.32 → v0.3.36) shipped major capabilities — `docs/project-context.md`, the scan LLM dispatcher chain, MCP sampling priority, scan-artifact LLM refinement, the first strict-drift PASS since v0.3.29 — none of which were reflected in `README.md` or `README.ko.md`. External adopters reading either file still saw the v0.3.13 capability inventory. v0.3.37 narrows that gap with a scoped headline refresh.

### Changed

- `README.md` + `README.ko.md` — Status paragraph (line 32) refreshed:
  - Version string `v0.3.13 ships at 589/589 tests` → `v0.3.36 develop ships at 743/743 tests`
  - Five new mid-paragraph capability bullets (project-context · dispatcher chain · MCP sampling · one-dispatcher refinement · strict-drift PASS)
  - Spec layout cell `47 total` → `110 total` (feature count) and the inline `× 87` reference also corrected to `× 110`
  - CLI block grows the `--scan / --no-scan / --no-llm` flags on `clad init` plus a `clad serve` line
- Historic content (Level table L0–L22, Status & roadmap v0.1.0 narrative, Spec Reference pin, Vocabulary, Related) deliberately preserved — those rows are point-in-time conformance snapshots, not running capability state

### Notes

- 743/743 tests passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; `clad sync`: 110 features valid
- No production code touched — pure README + spec hygiene
- The READMEs and `CHANGELOG.md` are now consistent; the next release event (v0.4.0 candidate or v0.3.x → main fast-forward) needs only the version-string sweep, not a capability gap-close

### Roadmap

- v0.3.38+ — LLM-assisted capability extraction (README headings → `spec/capabilities.yaml`)
- v0.3.38+ — sentinel-miss telemetry surfacing in `events.log`
- Release window — five unreleased capability cycles + one hygiene cycle queued; release timing is the maintainer's call

---

## [0.3.36] — 2026-05-20 — drift baseline cleanup — strict-drift is PASS again (F-18e951)

**Hygiene cycle.** After three consecutive LLM-refinement cycles (v0.3.33–v0.3.35) the drift baseline had accumulated 13 error + 1 warn findings — all leftover from the v0.3.29 production-grade scan refactor (855-line `src/cli/scan.ts` → 12 focused modules under `src/cli/scan/`). Five feature shards still pointed at the pre-refactor paths, F-2de65d.AC-004 lacked an explicit `condition` field, and `src/core/` was undeclared in `spec/architecture.yaml`. v0.3.36 fixes all three so `runDrift({strict: true})` reports `pass: true` for the first time since v0.3.29.

### Fixed

- **Five scan-feature shards remapped** onto the post-v0.3.29 module tree:
  - `scan-bfs-walk` → `src/cli/scan/{walker,thresholds}.ts`
  - `scan-conventions` → `src/cli/scan/{conventions,index,llm}.ts` + `src/cli/{init,clad}.ts`
  - `scan-polyglot` → `src/cli/scan/{thresholds,conventions}.ts`
  - `scan-residuals` → `src/cli/scan/{architecture,stats}.ts` + `src/cli/init.ts`
  - `scan-source-roots` → `src/cli/scan/{roots,architecture,llm}.ts` + `src/cli/{init,clad}.ts`
- **F-2de65d.AC-004 (drive-auto-rollback)** — EARS `unwanted` schema requires a `condition:` line starting with "if"; added `condition: if a halt class other than RETRY_THRESHOLD ends the loop` between `ears` and `action`. The text already carried the same conditional phrase, but the AC_DRIFT detector reads the structured field
- **`spec/architecture.yaml` foundation tier** — added `core` alongside spec/agents/events/hitl/optimizer/router/ui. `src/core/checkpoint.ts` + `src/core/postmortem.ts` are foundation utilities that the stage layer wraps

### Notes

- `runDrift({strict: true})` — **18 findings (13 error + 1 warn + 3 info) → 3 findings (all info), `pass: true`**
- The remaining 3 info-severity findings (`PERFORMANCE_DRIFT`, `EVIDENCE_MISMATCH`, `STALE_EVIDENCE`) are opt-in detectors that report "missing audit log artifacts" — baseline state of a project that hasn't run stage_3.2 / stage_4 manually, not real drift
- 743/743 tests passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; sync: 110 features valid
- No production code touched — pure spec-shard hygiene plus one architecture-tier declaration

### Roadmap

- v0.3.37+ — LLM-assisted capability extraction (README headings → `spec/capabilities.yaml`)
- v0.3.37+ — sentinel-miss telemetry surfacing in `events.log`

---

## [0.3.35] — 2026-05-20 — scan artifacts (conventions + architecture) inherit LLM refinement (F-17df0a)

**One dispatcher, every artifact.** v0.3.33 refined `docs/project-context.md`. v0.3.34 wired MCP sampling as Priority 1 of the chain. v0.3.35 extends the same chain to the deeper scan artifacts — `docs/conventions.md` and `spec/architecture.yaml` — so a hosted refinement session touches every cladding-authored markdown in one round-trip, not just the forest-level entry document.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `interpretScanWithFallback(scan, dispatcher)` wraps `interpretWithLlm` with the same deterministic-fallback policy as `renderProjectContextMdWithLlm`: dispatcher-null / throw / empty-section all collapse to `deterministicInterpret(scan)` so the resulting artifacts always carry real observed data
- `src/cli/init.ts` — dispatcher is now selected once at the top of `runInit` and the same instance is threaded into both `interpretScanWithFallback` and `renderProjectContextMdWithLlm`, so a hosted environment makes at most two round-trips per init regardless of which artifacts are written
- 5 new tests covering: dispatcher-null path · LLM success · dispatcher throw · empty-architecture sentinel-miss · header-only conventions sentinel-miss

### Notes

- 738 + 5 new tests = **743/743** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Deterministic path is byte-identical to v0.3.34 — projects without an LLM see no change
- The sentinel-miss guard (`!interp.architectureYaml.trim()`) means a malformed LLM reply collapses to the deterministic body instead of writing a broken `spec/architecture.yaml` — `clad sync` continues to load the file successfully

### Roadmap

- v0.3.36+ — LLM-assisted capability extraction (README headings → `spec/capabilities.yaml`)
- v0.3.36+ — sentinel-miss telemetry surfacing in `events.log` so adopters can tune their host's sampling policy

---

## [0.3.34] — 2026-05-20 — MCP sampling dispatcher closes the chain (F-7fa4a7)

**Hosted refinement, zero credentials.** v0.3.33 left Priority 1 of the dispatcher chain as a stub; v0.3.34 wires it through `server.createMessage`. When `clad serve` runs and a sampling-capable client (Claude Code · Cursor · Continue · …) is connected, the host owns the model + credentials and cladding only relays the prompt. Headless / CI environments keep the Anthropic-SDK direct path as fallback.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/dispatcher.ts` — `createMcpDispatcher(server)` builds a `(prompt: string) => Promise<string>` adapter that round-trips through the registered `SamplingCapableServer`. `selectDispatcher` Priority 1 now returns this dispatcher whenever `getHostMcpServer()` is non-null
- Non-text reply blocks (image / audio / tool_use) return an empty string so the dispatcher contract is honoured; the caller detects the empty payload through sentinel parsing and collapses to the deterministic body
- 4 new dispatcher tests covering: MCP wins over SDK · prompt passed verbatim · empty-string on non-text reply · `--no-llm` still wins over MCP

### Notes

- 734 + 4 new tests = **738/738** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Deterministic path is byte-identical to v0.3.33 — projects without a connected MCP host and without an API key see no change
- The `model` parameter is *advisory* under MCP sampling — the host's `createMessage` may route to whatever model the user has configured, but the dispatcher contract surfaces the parameter for telemetry symmetry with the Anthropic SDK path

### Roadmap

- v0.3.35+ — extend LLM refinement to `docs/conventions.md` + `spec/architecture.yaml` so the deeper scan artifacts also benefit from the chain (currently `interpretWithLlm` exists but `init.ts` does not call it)
- v0.3.35+ — LLM-assisted capability extraction (README headings → `spec/capabilities.yaml`)

---

## [0.3.33] — 2026-05-20 — scan LLM dispatcher chain + project-context refinement (F-417ff0)

**LLM as enhancement, not fallback.** v0.3.32 shipped the deterministic Why/What/Purpose extractor; v0.3.33 layers LLM refinement on top *when an LLM is reachable*, and collapses to the deterministic body on any failure. The dispatcher selection chain (MCP sampling → Anthropic SDK → null) keeps offline/CI environments fully reproducible while letting hosted environments produce polished prose.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/dispatcher.ts` (new) — `selectDispatcher(opts)` walks MCP sampling first, then a lazy Anthropic-SDK direct dispatcher when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `opts.apiKey`) is set, then `null`. `opts.noLlm` is a hard override that skips both branches
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — three new exports for the project-context refinement path:
  - `buildProjectContextPrompt(ctx, projectName)` — sentinel-labelled prompt (`=== WHY === / === WHAT === / === PURPOSE ===`) with the observed README quote, headings, doc links, and representative interfaces packed underneath
  - `parseProjectContextResponse(text)` — sentinel splitter, missing section → empty string
  - `renderProjectContextMdWithLlm(ctx, projectName, dispatcher)` — async; greenfield + dispatcher-null + any error path all return the deterministic body so the artifact is always usable; refined body keeps the raw README quote underneath the prose for audit
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `runInit` is now `async`, selects a dispatcher once, awaits the refined renderer when available, falls back to the synchronous deterministic renderer otherwise
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — `runInitCommand` awaits `runInit` so `process.exit` fires after the artifacts land
- 13 new tests covering the dispatcher chain (5) and the refinement path (8), including greenfield skip, dispatcher-null, and transport-error fallback

### Notes

- 721 + 13 new tests = **734/734** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean
- Deterministic path is byte-identical to v0.3.32 — projects without an LLM see no change
- Anthropic SDK is `require`d lazily so the cold-start of `clad init` stays fast for the deterministic-only majority
- MCP sampling branch is a registration stub in v0.3.33; v0.3.34 wires `server.createMessage` end-to-end. The SDK path runs in the meantime so projects with an API key already get refinement

### Roadmap

- v0.3.34 — MCP sampling dispatcher (`createMessage` through the registered `clad serve` server)
- v0.3.34+ — LLM-assisted capability extraction (README headings → `spec/capabilities.yaml`)

---

## [0.3.32] — 2026-05-20 — docs/project-context.md forest-level entry document (F-c8aef8)

**Forest before trees.** Every cladding workspace now ships a `docs/project-context.md` — the *Why / What / Purpose* document. Cladding's earlier surface (`docs/conventions.md` + `spec/architecture.yaml` + `spec/scenarios/`) covered code conventions and layers but never the project's *raison d'être*. v0.3.32 fills that gap with deterministic extraction (README + sibling docs + representative interfaces) when observable, a fill-in template otherwise. AI maintainers joining a cladding-managed project always find the *why* first.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan/docs.ts` (new) — four deterministic extractors:
  - `extractReadmeFirstParagraph(cwd)` — skips decorative HTML wrappers + badges, returns prose
  - `extractReadmeHeadings(cwd)` — top-10 `## ` headings in document order
  - `extractDocLinks(cwd)` — ARCHITECTURE/CONTRIBUTING/GOVERNANCE/SECURITY/CODE_OF_CONDUCT + `docs/*.md`, top-5 with first content line quoted
  - `extractInterfaceSignatures(filesByLayer)` — top-2 layers by module count, top-3 `export interface`/`export class` per layer
- `src/cli/scan/types.ts` — `ProjectContext` type + `ScanResult.projectContext: ProjectContext | null`
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `renderProjectContextMd(ctx, projectName)` renders observed body or template fallback (Why / What / Purpose / Top-level capabilities sections)
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `docs/project-context.md` written on every `clad init` (always). Scan artifact gate (`shouldWriteScanArtifacts`) auto-detects: scan only writes `docs/conventions.md` + `spec/architecture.yaml` + scenarios README when ≥ 3 source files observed or `--scan` forced
- 6 new tests covering README extraction, headings, doc links, interface signatures, absent-README null path, and README-only project
- `clad init --scan` description updated — "auto-detect by default, `--no-scan` to skip"

### Notes

- 715 + 6 new tests = **721/721** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 105 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- cobra rescan: project-context.md opens with `> Cobra is a library for creating powerful modern CLI applications.` — HTML wrappers stripped.
- fastapi rescan: same — `> FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production` after HTML strip.
- README-absent / source-absent projects get the template (Why / What / Purpose fill-in sections + Top-level capabilities checkboxes).
- Greenfield + brownfield share the same output path — origin differs (template vs observed), location identical.

### Symmetry

Feature + scenario + capabilities are *miniature-map style*: empty at adoption time, grow as the user requests features. `docs/project-context.md` is *forest-level*: always present, observed when possible, template otherwise. The two halves balance — observable surface auto-extracted, declared intent waits for user request.

### Roadmap

- v0.3.33+ — LLM refinement of Why/Purpose (raw README quote → polished prose)
- v0.3.34+ — `clad_create_feature` auto-registers scenario + capability id (LLM dispatcher chain)
- v0.4+ — `spec/capabilities.yaml` tree (capabilities grow miniature-map style as features request them)

## [0.3.31] — 2026-05-20 — Scan audit P1 deterministic fix — cwd resolve + forbidden prune + non-source blacklist (F-aa7197)

**5차 audit P1 residuals closed.** Three deterministic improvements close the remaining noise the 5차 audit (2026-05-20) flagged in the real-world OSS corpus: cobra's `.` layer-name bug, `forbidden_imports` N×N matrix bloat (ripgrep 195 + vitest 380+ entries), and non-source directories (HomebrewFormula / docs_src / formulas / packaging) surfacing as architecture layers.

### Changed

- **I15** — `src/cli/scan/architecture.ts:groupByLayer` calls `basename(resolve(opts.cwd))` instead of `basename(opts.cwd)`. cobra scanned with `cwd = '.'` now produces the layer name `cobra` (was: `.`).
- **I17** — `src/cli/scan/architecture.ts:extractArchitecture` introduces two prune rules: `FORBIDDEN_TRIVIAL_THRESHOLD = 2` skips layers with ≤ 2 files as both importer and target; `FORBIDDEN_TOP_K = 8` caps per-entry width. ripgrep's forbidden_imports rows drop from 13+ to ≤ 8.
- **I18** — `src/cli/scan/thresholds.ts:LAYER_BLACKLIST` adds `homebrewformula`, `formulas`, `packaging`, `docs_src`, `documentation`, `types`. `scripts` / `tools` intentionally NOT blacklisted (trade-off — some projects keep genuine source there).
- 3 new tests in `tests/cli/scan.test.ts` cover the three fixes plus an updated forbidden_imports fixture that now uses non-trivial layers.

### Notes

- 713 + 2 net new tests = **715/715** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 105 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- 16-OSS rescan deltas: cobra `.` → `cobra`; ripgrep loses HomebrewFormula and forbidden_imports rows cap at 8; vitest similarly capped; fastapi loses docs_src (still surfaces `scripts/`, intentional trade-off); cladding self-scan unchanged.
- Audit residuals queued for v0.4+: I16 language-specific export patterns (Python `__all__`, Go `package`, Rust `pub`) — needs language-plugin interface; I7 language-specific test locations.

## [0.3.30] — 2026-05-20 — Scenarios auto-generation deprecated + scenarios/README guide (F-cfba0c)

**Paradigm correction.** The 5차 real-world audit (2026-05-20) flagged dir-derived scenarios as a *false signal* — scenarios encode **user journeys** (intent), not architecture layers (observable code). v0.3.30 drops the auto-extraction. Features and scenarios are now *symmetric*: both describe declared intent, both start empty at adoption time, and both grow as the user requests features through `clad_create_feature`. The intent-side artifacts wait for the user; the observable-side artifacts (`docs/conventions.md` + `spec/architecture.yaml`) keep their auto-extraction.

### Changed

- `src/cli/scan/scenarios.ts` — `proposeScenarios` always returns `[]`. The function signature stays so type and call sites are unaffected; v0.3.31+ feature-time auto-registration can swap the body without re-introducing types.
- `src/cli/scan/llm.ts` — `deterministicInterpret` iterates `scan.scenarios` so its `scenarioFlows` Map naturally drops to empty.
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `--scan` branch no longer writes one YAML per layer. Instead writes a single `spec/scenarios/README.md` documenting the policy: scenarios encode user journeys, not architecture, and they enter the spec through `clad_create_feature`, not scan.
- `tests/cli/scan.test.ts` — `scenarios mirror layers` → `scenarios are not auto-extracted (v0.3.30 paradigm)`. Asserts layers detect normally while scenarios = [].

### Notes

- 713/713 tests pass; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 103 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- cobra rescan: `spec/scenarios/` holds **only `README.md`**; cladding self-scan + 16-OSS corpus all conform.
- Mental model alignment: feature + scenario are both miniature-map style. Adoption-time output ships zero scenarios + a placeholder feature; both grow when the user declares intent.

### Roadmap

- v0.3.31+ (큰 작업) — `clad_create_feature` auto-registers the scenario its feature belongs to, using the LLM dispatcher chain.
- v0.4+ — optional `clad scenarios --from-readme` verb for adopters who *want* a guess. Default OFF.

## [0.3.29] — 2026-05-20 — Scan production-grade refactor — src/cli/scan/ module split + configurable thresholds (F-1edb38)

**Production-grade structural refactor**, no behaviour change. v0.3.24~v0.3.28 grew the scan pipeline to a 855-line `scan.ts` + `scan-roots.ts` + `scan-llm.ts` flat trio that became hard to extend. v0.3.29 splits the pipeline into `src/cli/scan/<module>.ts` with a single orchestrator entry — every magic number now overrideable through `ScanOptions`, every analyzer in its own focused file.

### Changed

- `src/cli/scan.ts` (855L) + `src/cli/scan-roots.ts` (266L) + `src/cli/scan-llm.ts` (228L) → `src/cli/scan/{index,types,thresholds,walker,roots,conventions,architecture,examples,stats,scenarios,llm,helpers}.ts` (12 focused modules).
- `src/cli/scan/index.ts` — `scanRoot` orchestrator + public re-exports.
- `src/cli/scan/thresholds.ts` — `DEFAULT_MAX_FILES` / `PER_DIR_SOFT_CAP` / `ROOT_PROMOTION_THRESHOLD` / `DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS` / `DEFAULT_IGNORE` / `LAYER_BLACKLIST` / `ENTRYPOINT_NAMES` / `EXT_TO_LANGUAGE` — all tunable.
- `ScanOptions` gains `layerBlacklist`, `entrypoints`, `perDirCap`, `rootPromotionThreshold` so external adopters override without forking scan internals.
- `src/cli/init.ts` import path → `./scan/index.js`.
- Tests: import paths updated, no test-shape change.

### Notes

- **713/713 tests pass** unchanged; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 102 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- cladding self-scan + cobra/react/Signal-Android/django/rails rescan produce identical layer/scenario counts to the v0.3.28 baseline — pure structure change.
- v0.3.30+ follow-ups (scenario auto-generation policy, language plugin interface, LLM dispatcher integration, audit P1 residuals I15/I16/I17/I18) build on this clean base.

## [0.3.28] — 2026-05-20 — Scan BFS walk + entrypoint priority + per-directory soft cap (F-31eeb8)

**4차 audit residual fix (I14).** v0.3.27 left one known hole — react's `compiler/` (1858 files) saturated the DFS walker before it could descend into `packages/`, collapsing the architecture view to a single `compiler` layer. v0.3.28 rewrites the walker around three composable strategies:

1. **BFS queue** — directories visited level by level, siblings sampled before deep subtrees.
2. **Per-directory soft cap** (`PER_DIR_SOFT_CAP = 50`) — once a single directory contributes 50 files, the walker moves on; `maxFiles` stays the absolute hard cap.
3. **Entrypoint priority** — within each directory, conventional entry points (`index.*`, `main.*`, `lib.rs`, `mod.rs`, `__init__.py`, `__main__.py`, `Program.cs`, `Main.java`, `App.kt`) sort to the head so layer identity survives when the soft cap truncates the tail.

### Changed

- `src/cli/scan.ts:walk` — DFS recursion → BFS queue + entrypoint sort + per-directory soft cap. New `ENTRYPOINT_NAMES` set + `isEntrypointFile` predicate.
- 4 new tests in a `walk BFS strategy (v0.3.28)` describe block.
- `.cladding/audit/scan-real-world-2026-05-20.md` — 4차 audit table appended with the v0.3.28 react rescan.

### Notes

- 709 + 4 new tests = **713/713** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 101 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- **react rescan: 1 → 11 layers**. compiler + packages + scripts + shared + jest-react + react-devtools + flow-typed + internal-test-utils all visible.
- Other repos in the audit corpus (cobra, ripgrep, django, rails, RxSwiftExt, vuejs/core, vitest) keep their v0.3.27 layer sets — small-tree projects never hit the cap.
- Audit residuals I11/I12/I13/I14 all closed deterministically across v0.3.26~v0.3.28.

## [0.3.27] — 2026-05-20 — Scan deterministic residuals — flat _root promotion + workspace direct files + dominant language (F-aee1da)

**3차 audit residuals fix.** v0.3.26 left three known holes — cobra-style flat single-package returned layer 0, react workspace direct files (packages/react/src/ReactAct.js) lost their layer assignment, and polyglot repos reported `language: typescript` because `detectToolchain` always reads package.json first. v0.3.27 closes all three deterministically. The choice (over LLM fallback) preserves reproducibility and avoids adding an external API dependency to the adoption path.

### Added / Changed

- `src/cli/scan.ts` `groupByLayer` — _root bucket promotion. When 5+ source files live directly at cwd (Go single-package layout), the bucket moves to a layer named after `basename(cwd)`.
- `src/cli/scan.ts` `layerOf` — workspace direct file branch. `packages/<ws>/src/x.ts` with no intermediate subdirectory now surfaces under `<ws>` instead of being skipped.
- `src/cli/scan.ts` `ScanStats` — adds `languageCounts: Record<string, number>` (keyed by normalised language name) and `dominantLanguage: string` via the new `EXT_TO_LANGUAGE` map + `buildStats` helper.
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `runInit` prefers the scan dominant language over `detectToolchain` when `--scan` is set, so django reports python, rails reports ruby, RxSwiftExt reports swift, cobra reports go.
- 7 new scan tests across `flat _root promotion` / `workspace direct files` / `language detection` describe blocks.
- `.cladding/audit/scan-real-world-2026-05-20.md` — 3차 audit table appended with v0.3.27 deltas.

### Notes

- 702 + 7 new tests = **709/709** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 100 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Real-world rescan: cobra 0 → **1 layer + lang=go**, django 1 layer + **lang=python**, rails 6 + **lang=ruby**, RxSwiftExt 1 + **lang=swift**, vuejs/core 17 → **29 layers** (workspace direct files now visible).
- Flat src/ cladding-self regression: byte-identical (no cwd-direct files, no workspaces).
- New residual queued for v0.3.28: react's compiler/ holds 1858 files which exhausts the maxFiles=500 cap before walk reaches packages/. Needs per-directory cap or BFS sampling (I14).

## [0.3.26] — 2026-05-20 — Polyglot scan + layer blacklist + per-language docstrings (F-94dda4)

**P0 fix from the 2026-05-20 real-world OSS audit** (`.cladding/audit/scan-real-world-2026-05-20.md`). v0.3.25 walked only .ts/.js/.py so Go (gin, cobra), Rust (ripgrep), Java/Kotlin (Signal-Android), Ruby (rails), C# / PHP / Swift / Dart projects all produced empty `architecture.yaml`. v0.3.26 closes the language gap and removes the layer noise the audit also surfaced.

### Added / Changed

- `src/cli/scan.ts` `DEFAULT_EXTENSIONS` — now walks .ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.mjs/.cjs/.py/**.go/.rs/.java/.kt/.kts/.cs/.rb/.php/.swift**/.ex/.exs/.scala/.dart/.cpp/.cc/.cxx/.hpp/.h. cladding's polyglot 9-language promise is now real.
- `src/cli/scan.ts` `LAYER_BLACKLIST` (new) — peer directories (tests, docs, examples, typings, e2e, integration, __fixtures__, fixtures, benchmark/s, bench, playground/s, demo/s, samples) walked for conventions but excluded from the architecture view. Case-insensitive (matches `Tests/`, `Playground/`).
- `src/cli/scan.ts` `detectDocBlockRatio` + `detectDocTagCounts` — six language families: JS/TS/Java/Kotlin/C++/C#/Scala/Dart (classic `/** */`), Python (triple-quoted + Args:/Returns:/Raises:/Examples:), Go (leading `//` block + godoc `Deprecated:`), Rust (`///` + `# Errors` / `# Safety`), Swift (`///`), Ruby (leading `#` block).
- `tests/cli/scan.test.ts` — 11 new tests across 3 describe blocks (polyglot extensions · layer blacklist · multi-language docblock).
- `.cladding/audit/scan-real-world-2026-05-20.md` — 2차 audit table appended with the v0.3.26 rescan deltas.

### Notes

- 691 + 11 new tests = **702/702** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 99 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Rescan verification: gin 0 → **7 layers**, ripgrep 0 → **6 layers**, Signal-Android 3 layers (Kotlin recognised), rails 6 layers (Ruby + monorepo). Flat-`src/` cladding-self regression: byte-identical.
- OSS reuse review: tree-sitter (polyglot AST) deferred to v0.4+ plugin — wasm/native dependency conflicts with cladding's single-bundle philosophy. dependency-cruiser / linguist-js / semgrep all evaluated and declined; current heuristics + new language matrix carries us until external dogfood signals tree-sitter need.
- Known residuals (queued for v0.3.27): cobra-style flat single-package layer 0; workspace `<ws>/src/*.js` direct files miss layer assignment (react); language detection still package.json-biased so polyglot repos report `language: typescript`.

## [0.3.25] — 2026-05-20 — Scan source-root inference + forbidden_imports candidates (F-c48eb2)

**Closes the `src/`-only limitation in v0.3.24.** External adopters with a TypeScript monorepo, a Python project keeping its package at root, a Go layout (`cmd/` / `internal/` / `pkg/`), or a Rust workspace (`crates/<x>/src/`) all hit the same wall: scan only knew about flat `src/<layer>/`. v0.3.25 introduces manifest-driven source-root inference plus deterministic `forbidden_imports` candidates so the generated `spec/architecture.yaml` no longer ships an empty list.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan-roots.ts` (new) — `inferSourceRoots` reads `package.json#workspaces` (array + `{packages}`), `pyproject.toml` packages list, `Cargo.toml` `[workspace] members` (or single-crate `src/`), and `go.mod` (surfacing `cmd/` + `internal/` + `pkg/`); falls back to directory heuristics (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `pkg/`, `cmd/`, `internal/`, `packages/*/src/`, `apps/*/src/`, `crates/*/src/`). An explicit `--roots a/src,b/src` override skips both phases.
- `src/cli/scan.ts` `layerOf` now takes the inferred `SourceRoot[]` and prefixes monorepo layers with their workspace name (`<workspaceName>:<layer>`) so two workspaces sharing an internal layer name keep distinct identities.
- `src/cli/scan.ts` `extractArchitecture` records every unobserved layer-pair under `forbiddenImportCandidates`; `scan-llm.ts` `renderArchitectureYaml` writes them into `spec/architecture.yaml` `forbidden_imports` lists with a comment noting they are reviewer-pruned candidates.
- `--roots <list>` CLI flag on `clad init` for explicit overrides.
- 13 new scan-roots tests + 5 new scan tests (3 root inference + 2 forbidden candidates) = 18 additions.

### Notes

- 673 + 18 new tests = **691/691** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 99 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Flat-`src/` projects (cladding itself included) keep byte-identical layer names — the v0.3.24 dogfood smoke is unaffected.
- forbidden_imports candidates are coarse — every unobserved pair surfaces — so the comment in architecture.yaml explicitly tells reviewers to prune. v0.3.26 (planned) will let the LLM dispatcher rank them.
- MCP sampling dispatcher integration (originally scoped to v0.3.25) deferred to v0.3.26. Tier-2 audit progress: (#1) Pulse UI v0.3.23, Existing Project v0.3.24, **scan robustness v0.3.25 (this PR)**.

## [0.3.24] — 2026-05-20 — `clad init --scan` observed-conventions extractor (F-9b643e)

**Existing Project 시나리오 도입 (ironclad-design 07-ssot-init §3 B).** External projects adopting cladding no longer face an empty spec.yaml + no conventions doc. A single `clad init --scan` walks the source tree, extracts 14 deterministic convention signals plus representative example modules per layer, and writes three artifacts so AI maintainers can keep the project in the same shape the original authors used — same function signatures, same comment style, same module boilerplate.

### Added

- `src/cli/scan.ts` (new) — deterministic walker + 14-convention extractor (indent, quote, semicolon, naming exports + constants, docblock ratio + tag counts, import order, export pattern, error handling, type-def location, file header pattern, test location, module boilerplate). Picks the longest non-test module per layer as the representative example, paired with its sibling test when present.
- `src/cli/scan-llm.ts` (new) — `buildPrompt` + `parseLlmResponse` + `interpretWithLlm` (LLM path, dispatcher injectable) + `deterministicInterpret` (`--no-llm` fallback). Three labelled sections (`CONVENTIONS_MD` / `ARCHITECTURE_YAML` / `SCENARIO_FLOWS`) so the prompt-shape stays stable across v0.3.24 (deterministic) and v0.3.25 (MCP sampling wiring).
- `src/cli/init.ts` — `--scan` branch writes `docs/conventions.md`, `spec/architecture.yaml`, and one `spec/scenarios/<slug>.yaml` per layer. Existing files divert to `.cladding/scan/<basename>.proposal` instead of overwriting authored content (same propose pattern as v0.3.19 `--propose-archive`).
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — `--scan` and `--no-llm` flags on the `init` subcommand.
- `tests/cli/scan.test.ts` + `tests/cli/scan-llm.test.ts` (new) — 14 convention branches + LLM prompt/response + deterministic fallback + 1 new CLI test for `--scan` + `--no-llm` flow.

### Notes

- v0.3.24 default = deterministic interpreter for `--scan`. The LLM dispatcher injection (specialist persona via MCP sampling) lands in v0.3.25.
- feature 자동 추출 안 함 — scenario placeholder만. feature 는 작업자가 `clad_create_feature` 호출 시 점진 추가 (미니맵 확장식).
- Tier-2 audit progress: (#1) ✓ Pulse UI v0.3.23, (#2) Territory Minimap deferred, **(new) ✓ Existing Project 시나리오 v0.3.24 — 작업 가이드라인 자동 추출**.

## [0.3.23] — 2026-05-20 — Pulse UI progressive in drive loop (F-ba4b7a)

**First Tier-2 audit fix** (ironclad-design 03-ux §4.1). Until v0.3.22 a `clad drive` invocation staring at a slow agent dispatch looked frozen — the terminal sat idle until the next transition emitted a `pulse` line. v0.3.23 introduces an in-place progressive surface so the user sees which phase is running while it runs, without breaking the original `tail -f`-friendly `pulse` contract.

### Added

- `src/ui/pulse.ts` — two new exports: `pulseProgress(stage, label, detail?)` writes a clear-line ANSI sequence + status (no trailing newline) so successive calls overwrite the same TTY row; `pulseProgressEnd(kind, label, detail?)` commits the final transition with a newline. On non-TTY both surfaces are silent until `pulseProgressEnd`, which emits one line equivalent to `pulse` — captured stdout stays a clean append-only stream.
- `src/drive/loop.ts` — emits `pulseProgress('drive', ready.id, …)` for the four phases (specialist · L1 gates · reviewer · UAT) and `pulseProgressEnd('pass'|'fail', …)` on every exit path (happy completion, gate fail with retry counter, reviewer collision, transport failure, UAT, retry-threshold rollback).
- 7 new pulse tests + 2 new drive-loop tests = 9 additions.

### Notes

- 638 + 9 new tests = **647/647** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 97 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Original `pulse` function unchanged — existing CI consumers and `tail -f` workflows see byte-identical output.
- The fail branch's detail string carries the retry counter (`retry N/3`) so the user knows how many attempts remain before auto-rollback.
- `clad check` (13 stage) progressive coverage is a separate patch candidate.

## [0.3.22] — 2026-05-20 — Iron Law backbone Phase 3.3: Librarian post-mortem on auto-rollback (F-5d3ed2)

**Third and final patch** of the Iron Law backbone (ironclad-design 02-iron-law §2.5). v0.3.20 shipped the event surface, v0.3.21 wired the drive loop's auto-rollback, and v0.3.22 closes the loop with a Librarian-authored post-mortem so the next session has a maintainer-readable brief instead of just an audit-log entry.

### Added

- `src/core/postmortem.ts` (new) — `writePostMortem(cwd, ctx)` creates `.cladding/post-mortems/` on demand and writes `post-mortem-<F-id>-<sanitised-ts>.md`. Body captures feature id, last failed gate, retry count, checkpoint git head + spec digest, maintainer-runnable recovery command, and the `librarian` author tag. Two rollbacks of the same feature produce two files (no overwrite).
- `src/drive/loop.ts` — tracks the last failed gate per feature in a `lastFailedGate` Map and, immediately after `recordRollback`, calls `writePostMortem` with the failure context. Skipped when no prior checkpoint exists (defensive, matches the rollback contract).
- 6 new postmortem unit tests + 2 new drive-loop tests = 8 additions.

### Phase 3.3 boundary

Cladding writes the post-mortem to disk but does **not** inject it into the next agent dispatch's context. AgentContext shape changes are a v0.3.x+ follow-up; v0.3.22 keeps the file authoring surface minimal so a maintainer can read it manually without upstream context-injection wiring.

### Notes

- 630 + 8 new tests = **638/638** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 96 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Sanitised timestamp: `2026-05-20T12:34:56.789Z` → filename segment `2026-05-20T12-34-56-789Z` (colon + period replaced).
- No-git-head checkpoint fallback: the recovery block reads `restore spec.yaml manually from VCS history` instead of a `git checkout` command, so the post-mortem stays usable in projects cladding tracked outside a git repo.
- Tier-1 audit complete: (1) ✓ Atomic AC fan-out (v0.3.18), (2) ✓ Phased Decommissioning Tier 2 (v0.3.19), (3.1) ✓ Checkpoint event surface (v0.3.20), (3.2) ✓ Drive auto-rollback (v0.3.21), **(3.3) ✓ Librarian post-mortem (this PR)**. The ironclad-design 02-iron-law §2.5 Iron Law backbone is operational end-to-end.

## [0.3.21] — 2026-05-20 — Iron Law backbone Phase 3.2: drive loop auto-rollback (F-2de65d)

**Second of three patches** completing the Iron Law backbone. v0.3.20 shipped the event surface (`feature_checkpoint`, `feature_rolled_back`) and manual CLI verbs. v0.3.21 hooks the autonomous loop into it: every ready feature gets a checkpoint pinned before the first specialist dispatch, and every `RETRY_THRESHOLD` halt now records a rollback to that feature's latest checkpoint. The Iron Law §2.5 contract ("auto-rollback after self-healing budget exhausted") is now operational on every `clad drive` invocation.

### Changed

- `src/drive/loop.ts` — calls `recordCheckpoint(cwd, ready.id)` immediately after `featuresTouched.push()` and before the specialist agent dispatch.
- `src/drive/loop.ts` — when `checkBudget` returns a `RETRY_THRESHOLD` halt, the loop now locates the exhausted feature in the `retries` map, fetches its latest checkpoint via `findLatestCheckpoint`, and (when non-null) calls `recordRollback` with the reason `"retry budget exhausted after N attempts"`. The halt is then returned via `finish()` so the audit-log order stays checkpoint → drift_detected* → feature_rolled_back → halt.

### Notes

- 626 + 4 new drive-loop tests = **630/630** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 95 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Defensive: when `findLatestCheckpoint` returns null (fresh repo, missing prior checkpoint), the rollback record is skipped so the audit trail never references a checkpoint that never existed.
- Non-RETRY_THRESHOLD halts (MAX_ITERATIONS, WALL_CLOCK, BUDGET_EXCEEDED, transport classes, ALL_FEATURES_DONE) finish without a rollback event — the rollback event is reserved for the one transition that genuinely needs the Iron Law fallback.
- Tier-1 audit progress: (1) ✓ Atomic AC fan-out, (2) ✓ Phased Decommissioning Tier 2, (3.1) ✓ Checkpoint event surface, **(3.2) ✓ Drive auto-rollback (this PR)**, (3.3) Librarian post-mortem queued (v0.3.22).

## [0.3.20] — 2026-05-20 — Iron Law backbone Phase 1: checkpoint event infrastructure (F-c2c996)

**Third Tier-1 audit fix, Phase 1 of 3.** ironclad-design 02-iron-law §2.5 ("Integrity Checkpoint & Rollback") names the Iron Law backbone: every `work` should pin a SSoT + code snapshot, and a failed self-healing cycle should fall back to it. Cladding had **none** of that — the prior conversation grep showed `rollback`/`checkpoint`/`snapshot`/`stash`/`post-mortem` all at zero hits. v0.3.20 lays the *event* surface; later patches (v0.3.21, v0.3.22) hook the drive loop and Librarian post-mortem on top.

### Added

- `src/core/checkpoint.ts` (new) — exposes `recordCheckpoint(cwd, featureId)`, `findLatestCheckpoint(cwd, featureId)`, and `recordRollback(cwd, featureId, target, reason?)`. The checkpoint tuple holds `{featureId, gitHead, specDigest, timestamp}`; `computeSpecDigest` is a deterministic SHA-256 over `spec.yaml` + sorted `spec/features/*.yaml` + sorted `spec/scenarios/*.yaml` contents and relative paths.
- `src/events/log.ts` — `EventType` union grows from 6 to 8 entries with `feature_checkpoint` and `feature_rolled_back`. Existing 6 entries stay in the same order so jsonl consumers do not regress.
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — two new subcommands: `clad checkpoint <featureId>` records and prints the head/digest summary; `clad rollback <featureId> --reason <reason>` records the rollback event and prints the maintainer-runnable `git checkout` for the latest checkpoint. The verb list expands from 8 to 10 in stable insertion order.
- `tests/core/checkpoint.test.ts` (new, 11 unit tests) + 5 new CLI tests covering exit codes, mock dispatch, and the createProgram-verb count.

### Phase 1 boundary

Cladding **does not** execute the actual `git checkout` or spec restore. Branch policy varies — force-with-lease vs reset --hard vs revert commits — and the right choice depends on the working-tree state. v0.3.20 records the transition and surfaces the git command; the maintainer (or, in v0.3.21+, the drive loop) runs it.

### Notes

- 609 + 17 new tests = **626/626** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 94 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Tier-1 audit progress: (1) ✓ Atomic AC fan-out (v0.3.18), (2) ✓ Phased Decommissioning Tier 2 (v0.3.19), **(3) ⚙ Auto-rollback Phase 1 (this PR)**, (3.2) drive-loop auto-rollback queued, (3.3) Librarian post-mortem queued.

## [0.3.19] — 2026-05-20 — Phased Decommissioning Tier 2 (F-b99577)

**Second of three Tier-1 fixes** from the 2026-05-20 ironclad-design audit. `STALE_SPECIFICATION` had been emitting warn-only findings since v0.1.x — the maintainer (or anyone reading `clad check`) saw the noise but the path to fixing it was manual. The structural reason was that `DriftFinding` exposed only `severity` + `message`; there was no field for a machine-actionable remediation hint. v0.3.19 introduces that field (`suggestion`) and uses it to wire the first Phased Decommissioning Tier 2 (ironclad-design 07-ssot-init §5) entry point.

### Added

- `src/stages/types.ts` — new `DriftSuggestion` interface (`{action: string, args?: Record<string, unknown>}`) and optional `suggestion` field on `DriftFinding`. Existing 24 detectors stay unaffected because the field is optional.
- `src/stages/detectors/stale-specification.ts` — emits `propose-archive` suggestions on three lifecycle-inconsistency branches:
  - `archived_at` set with non-archived status
  - `superseded_by` set without `archived_at`
  - **new**: non-final feature (planned/in_progress) whose every declared module has vanished from disk
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — new `clad sync --propose-archive` flag. Runs the detector, filters findings whose `suggestion.action === 'propose-archive'`, prints one Pulse note per candidate with `featureId + reason`, then a summary. Exit 0 either way — the maintainer (or Librarian agent) decides whether to write `archived_at`.
- `src/agents/librarian.md` — explicit Tier 2 responsibility documented: walk `clad sync --propose-archive` candidates, confirm each, write `archived_at + archive_reason`. Never archive silently.
- 5 new STALE_SPECIFICATION tests + 2 new CLI tests = 7 net additions.

### Notes

- 602 + 7 new tests = **609/609** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 93 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- The `archived feature with surviving modules` branch deliberately stays unsuggested — removal cadence is project-owned, so the warning surfaces but no automated action is proposed.
- ironclad-design Tier-1 audit recap: (1) ✓ Atomic AC fan-out (v0.3.18), **(2) ✓ Phased Decommissioning Tier 2 (this PR)**, (3) Auto-rollback / Checkpoint (v0.4.0 minor, queued).

## [0.3.18] — 2026-05-20 — Atomic AC evidence fan-out in drive loop (F-12d740)

**Closes the AC-granularity gap in the anti-self-cert guard.** The HITL evidence framework (v0.2.x) added `Evidence.acId` to the schema and `anti-self-cert.checkAc()` filters by `e.acId === acId`, but the drive loop never populated the field — every `clad drive` evidence entry was feature-scoped, so the guard saw only unattributed tool/LLM evidence and could not tell which AC was missing its human-author sign-off. v0.3.18 fans the per-feature L1-pass evidence out into one entry per acceptance criterion, completing the Atomic AC chain (ironclad-design 11-ssot-refinement §4.1 + 02-iron-law §2.4).

### Changed

- `src/drive/loop.ts` — when a feature declares `acceptance_criteria`, the drive loop now calls `appendEvidence` once per AC with `evidence.acId` populated; features without ACs keep the legacy single feature-scoped entry as a fallback (byte-identical audit-log content for them).
- 3 new drive-loop tests cover the fan-out, the fallback, and the `identity.author=tool` invariant (the fan-out increases granularity, not authority — anti-self-cert still requires a separate human evidence on top).

### Notes

- 599 + 3 new tests = **602/602** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 92 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Identity `author=tool, name=clad-drive` stays on every drive-loop evidence — the fan-out is a granularity refinement, not a self-cert loophole.
- ironclad-design audit (2026-05-20) recap — three Tier-1 vision gaps identified: **(1) Atomic AC fan-out (this PR, done)**, (2) Phased Decommissioning Tier 2 (v0.3.x patch, queued), (3) Auto-rollback / Checkpoint (v0.4.0 minor, queued).

## [0.3.17] — 2026-05-20 — Detector-count auto-recompute (F-092)

**Second of two automations** closing the concurrent-modification audit (2026-05-20). `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declared the drift-detector count in two places (`ironclad.current.detectors` and `ironclad.target.detectors`) as a `N/N` string, and every detector addition required a manual edit there. Two contributors each adding a detector on parallel branches merged cleanly on the filesystem but silently left the count at `(N+1)/(N+1)` instead of `(N+2)/(N+2)` — manual edits don't compose. `HARNESS_INTEGRITY` caught the drift after the fact, but the floor was "trust the maintainer to bump twice". v0.3.17 promotes the filesystem itself to source-of-truth.

### Added

- `scripts/build-plugin.mjs` Phase D — counts non-index `.ts` files under `src/stages/detectors/` and rewrites both `ironclad.current.detectors` and `ironclad.target.detectors` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to the resulting `N/N`. Idempotent (no rewrite when already in sync) so `npm run build:plugin` is safe to run on every commit.
- `tests/scripts/build-plugin-detector-count.test.ts` — 4 unit tests covering drift recompute, idempotency, unrelated-parent immunity (anchored regex), and the index.ts exclusion.
- `spec/features/detector-count-auto-recompute-098d3b.yaml` — F-092 spec (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md` — the detector-count-bump reminder now says "automated; just rerun `npm run build:plugin`" instead of pointing maintainers at manual edits.

### Notes

- 595 + 4 new tests = **599/599** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 91 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- The concurrent-modification audit (2026-05-20) found three high-risk sites: version field (v0.3.15 ✓), detector count (v0.3.17 ✓), CHANGELOG Unreleased-block. The third stays deferred — fragment-directory tooling is over-engineering for a 1-maintainer cadence; revisit when multi-dev signal arrives.

## [0.3.16] — 2026-05-20 — Dogfood recovery + maintainer guide (F-091)

**Restores cladding's own dogfood promise.** User audit caught it: v0.3.9 introduced the hash-based spec ID model (`F-<hash6>` filenames + slug field) for external users, but the cladding maintainer (Claude) authored the next nine spec entries (F-082 ~ F-090) by hand with the legacy sequential format. cladding was recommending one pattern to users while practicing another internally.

### Changed (migration)

- 9 spec/features files renamed from `F-NNN.yaml` to `<slug>-<hash6>.yaml`:
  - `F-082` → `gemini-cli-dogfood-b61449`
  - `F-083` → `claude-code-dogfood-6f80e7`
  - `F-084` → `spec-id-multi-dev-safety-67e33f`
  - `F-085` → `spec-id-hash-filename-and-lookup-24062d`
  - `F-086` → `multidev-integration-test-and-scenario-regex-59f093`
  - `F-087` → `scenario-hash-model-d7312b`
  - `F-088` → `architecture-from-spec-42af48`
  - `F-089` → `external-docs-update-v0-3-13-fcece7`
  - `F-090` → `version-bump-script-6d943d`
- `depends_on` cross-references in 5 other feature files rewritten to point at the new hash ids.
- Legacy `F-001` ~ `F-083.yaml` files (pre-v0.3.9) stay sequential — they're stable audit-log identifiers.

### Added

- `scripts/migrate-dogfood-v0.3.16.mjs` — one-shot migration script, committed as a permanent record of what changed.
- `CLAUDE.md` — maintainer-facing guide. Captures the spec-authoring invariant ("DO NOT hand-create F-NNN.yaml — DO use `<slug>-<hash>.yaml`"), the version-bump-script reminder, the detector-count-bump reminder, and the plugin-mirror caveat. Read by AI assistants when working inside the cladding repo.
- `spec/features/dogfood-recovery-v0-3-16-245bd5.yaml` — F-091 spec authored in the hash format as the first worked example of the new authoring rule.

### Notes

- 595/595 vitest pass (no test code changes); lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 90 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- The `ID_COLLISION` and `SLUG_CONFLICT` detectors stayed silent through the migration — no inadvertent duplicates introduced.
- v0.3.17 plan: `build-plugin.mjs` auto-recomputes the `ironclad.current.detectors` count so the count-bump reminder in `CLAUDE.md` graduates from manual to automatic.

## [0.3.15] — 2026-05-20 — Atomic version-bump script (F-090)

**First of two automations** addressing the concurrent-modification audit (2026-05-20). Until v0.3.15 the cladding version string lived in **seven separate files** (`package.json`, three host-plugin manifests, `src/cli/clad.ts`, `src/serve/server.ts`, `tests/cli/clad.test.ts`) and every patch cycle a maintainer had to hand-edit each one — error-prone, and two contributors bumping in parallel collided on all seven. v0.3.15 collapses the ritual into a single command.

### Added

- `scripts/version-bump.mjs` — accepts one SemVer argument (major.minor.patch) and atomically updates all seven sites. Per-file summary on stdout, errors on stderr, exit-zero is idempotent. Strict-only validation (rejects pre-release / build-metadata strings).
- `npm run version-bump -- 0.3.16` shortcut in `package.json` scripts.
- `tests/scripts/version-bump.test.ts` — 6 unit tests (happy path, idempotent re-run, invalid SemVer, missing arg, broken anchor in one file).
- `spec/features/F-090.yaml` — "Atomic version-bump script" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 589 + 6 new tests = **595/595** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 89 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- v0.3.16 plan: `build-plugin.mjs` auto-recomputes `ironclad.current.detectors` count so the second high-risk concurrent-modification site (silent miscalc when two contributors add detectors in parallel) is also closed.
- The audit's third high-risk site (CHANGELOG.md Unreleased-block collision) stays in the deferred bucket — fragment-directory tooling is over-engineering for a 1-maintainer cadence; revisit when multi-dev signal arrives.

## [0.3.14] — 2026-05-20 — External user docs update (F-089)

**Docs-only patch.** READMEs and `docs/spec-ids-multi-dev.md` had drifted to a v0.3.3 snapshot (capability lines, drift-detector count, feature count, version number) while the code raced ahead to v0.3.13. v0.3.14 brings external-facing docs into alignment so users reading the project for the first time get an accurate snapshot.

### Changed

- `README.md` + `README.ko.md` status lines — version bumped to v0.3.13 · test count 509 → 589 · drift-detector count 20 → 24 (lists all 5 cladding extensions now: `FIXTURE_REFERENCE_INVALID`, `SLUG_CONFLICT`, `ID_COLLISION`, `AC_DUPLICATE_WITHIN_FEATURE`, `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC`) · feature file count 77 → 87. Two new capability lines added: "multi-developer-safe spec IDs" (hash-based F-/S- ids · slug-prefixed filenames · namespace-aware drift detectors) and "spec/architecture.yaml as working invariant" (ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC detector enforces forbidden_imports + layer alignment).
- `docs/spec-ids-multi-dev.md` extended:
  - Scenario id row added to the short-version table (`S-<hash6>`, feature-symmetric since v0.3.12, separate id namespace from features).
  - "How features and scenarios get created" section now mentions `clad_create_scenario` MCP tool with the natural-language example `"Add a scenario for the checkout happy-path"`.
  - New "spec/architecture.yaml — working invariant since v0.3.13" section documenting the three `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC` invariants (forbidden_imports compliance, undeclared directory, empty layer) with an example yaml.

### Added

- `spec/features/F-089.yaml` — "External user docs update" (3 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 589/589 vitest pass (no test changes — docs-only); lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 88 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- This patch closes the user-facing visibility gap opened by the v0.3.4 → v0.3.13 internal velocity. External adopters reading READMEs or the multi-dev guide now see what cladding actually ships at v0.3.13.

## [0.3.13] — 2026-05-20 — ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC detector + cladding self-architecture aligned (F-088)

**Resurrects spec/architecture.yaml from dead code.** Until v0.3.13 the layers and forbidden_imports fields were type-loaded but no detector read them — externally visible as production-grade but actually placeholder. v0.3.13 ships the detector that consumes them, and brings cladding's own architecture file into alignment with the live src/ layout.

### Added

- `src/stages/detectors/architecture-from-spec.ts` — `ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC` drift detector. Enforces three invariants:
  - **forbidden_imports compliance (error)** — regex-greps every `src/<from-layer>/**.ts` for `import ... from` statements; matches the path's segments against the rule's `to` layer; one error per file × rule violation.
  - **undeclared directory (warn)** — any 1-depth directory under `src/` not listed in `spec.architecture.layers`.
  - **empty layer (warn)** — any layer named in `spec.architecture.layers` with no matching `src/<layer>/` directory.
- The detector is **toolchain-agnostic** — no madge / import-linter dependency, regex grep only. Coexists with the existing `ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION` (toolchain-driven, catches cycles).
- `tests/stages/architecture-from-spec.test.ts` — 10 unit tests covering happy path, all three invariants, soft-validator behaviour, multi-rule violations, external-package import exclusion.
- `spec/features/F-088.yaml` — "ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC detector" (6 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `spec/architecture.yaml` — brought into alignment with the live `src/` layout. Lists all 12 src/ 1-depth directories across **4 dependency tiers**:
  1. **Foundation**: `spec` · `agents` · `events` · `hitl` · `optimizer` · `router` · `ui`
  2. **Stage / adapter**: `stages` · `adapters`
  3. **Runtime**: `drive` · `serve`
  4. **Entry**: `cli`
- 9 forbidden_imports rules forbid backward dependencies (`spec → stages/drive/cli/serve`, `stages → drive/cli/serve`, `adapters → drive/cli/serve`).
- `src/stages/detectors/index.ts` — `allDetectors` now lists 24 detectors (23 → 24).
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `ironclad.current.detectors` bumped `23/23` → `24/24` so HARNESS_INTEGRITY count stays green.

### Notes

- 579 + 10 new tests = **589/589** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; **drift-green at 87 features with the new detector active**; bundle 1.1 MB.
- The detector caught cladding's own architecture-spec ↔ src/ drift on the first run (12 warnings: 10 undeclared dirs + 2 empty layers). Fixing the spec was the first dogfood proof that the detector works end-to-end.
- External adopters writing `spec/architecture.yaml` now get real cross-checks; previously the same yaml was cosmetic.
- v0.3.x cleanup arc is now genuinely closed: multi-dev ID safety (F-084/85/86/87) + architecture invariant (F-088). No remaining dead-code surfaces in the spec layer.

## [0.3.12] — 2026-05-20 — Scenario hash ID model — true final of the multi-dev arc (F-087)

**Symmetry with features.** v0.3.9 → v0.3.11 closed the multi-developer ID-safety loop for *features* but left *scenarios* on the old sequential model (`S-NNN.yaml`, manual id assignment) — user audit caught this gap. v0.3.12 ports the entire hash-id + slug + multi-dev safety pattern to scenarios.

### Added

- `src/spec/new.ts` — `createScenario({slug, title?, features?, cwd?})` internal helper. Same hash-id model as `createFeature`; the hash input adds a `'scenario'` namespace prefix so a feature and a scenario sharing slug + timestamp produce different hashes.
- `src/serve/server.ts` — new MCP tool **`clad_create_scenario(slug, title?, features?)`**. No CLI verb (same surface boundary as `clad_create_feature`).
- `tests/spec/new-scenario.test.ts` — 6 unit tests covering filename layout, yaml shape, defaults, repeat-call distinctness, slug validation, feature/scenario namespace coexistence.
- `tests/stages/slug-conflict.test.ts` — 2 new cases (two scenarios sharing a slug raises error; feature and scenario sharing a slug does NOT raise — separate namespaces).
- `tests/stages/id-collision.test.ts` — 2 new cases (two scenarios sharing an id raises error; feature F- and scenario S- ids do not collide).
- `tests/serve/server.test.ts` — `clad_create_scenario` MCP tool integration test.
- `spec/features/F-087.yaml` — "Scenario hash ID model — same multi-dev safety as features" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/spec/schema.json` — scenario `id` regex widened from `^S-\d{3,}$` to `^S-(\d{3,}|[a-f0-9]{6,})$`; new optional scenario `slug` field with kebab-case regex.
- `src/stages/detectors/slug-conflict.ts` — now walks features and scenarios in separate namespaces. Feature and scenario with the same slug do NOT collide.
- `src/stages/detectors/id-collision.ts` — now walks features and scenarios as separate id namespaces. Error messages name the kind (`feature` vs `scenario`).

### Notes

- 568 + 11 new tests = **579/579** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 86 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- **Multi-developer ID-safety arc is now genuinely complete.** Features (F-084 / F-085 / F-086) and scenarios (F-087) both have hash ids, slug filenames, namespace-aware detectors, and integration-test coverage. No remaining sequential ID surfaces in the spec layer.
- `docs/spec-ids-multi-dev.md` (from v0.3.10) covers features only — a follow-up patch could extend the same guidance to scenarios, but the model is identical so the existing doc generalises naturally.

## [0.3.11] — 2026-05-20 — Multi-dev concurrent simulation test + scenario regex widening (F-086)

**Final cycle of the multi-developer ID-safety arc.** Closes the verification loop: an integration test simulates two contributors concurrently calling `createFeature` and asserts the safety invariant end-to-end. A 10-axis ID integrity audit caught one stray legacy regex in scenarios (the only fix from the audit), now also closed.

### Added

- `tests/integration/multi-dev-merge.test.ts` — 4 sub-tests covering:
  - **different slugs** simultaneously → file paths distinct, merge clean, no detector findings
  - **same slug** simultaneously across two cwds → file paths distinct (hash entropy), `ID_COLLISION` silent, `SLUG_CONFLICT` raises one error on the merged spec
  - **same cwd repeat call** with same slug → two distinct files, `SLUG_CONFLICT` raises
  - **three contributors** with distinct slugs → three files merge clean
- `tests/spec/load.test.ts` — regression test: a scenario referencing both `F-001` (legacy) and `F-a3f9c2` (hash) loads without schema rejection.
- `spec/features/F-086.yaml` — "Multi-dev concurrent simulation test + scenario regex widening" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/spec/schema.json` — scenario `features[]` items pattern widened from `^F-\d{3,}$` to `^F-(\d{3,}|[a-f0-9]{6,})$` (same as feature.id / depends_on / superseded_by). v0.3.9 missed this single pattern; the v0.3.11 audit caught it.

### Notes

- 563 + 5 new tests = **568/568** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 85 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- ID integrity audit covered 10 axes (scenario regex, BR/ADR, references, AC composite, audit log, panel/CLI, detectors, AC scope, slug-hash hyphen, plugin manifests). 9 axes already-compatible from v0.3.9 + v0.3.10; only the scenario regex needed a one-line fix.
- **Multi-developer ID-safety arc complete** (F-084 + F-085 + F-086). cladding ships a documented, audited, integration-tested model for distributed concurrent feature creation. No outstanding items in this thread.

## [0.3.10] — 2026-05-20 — Hash filename + slug-friendly lookup + multi-dev guide (F-085)

**Closes the multi-dev concurrency loop.** v0.3.9 introduced the hash-id model but kept the filename at `<slug>.yaml`, meaning two contributors with the same slug still throw on the second `createFeature` call. v0.3.10 moves the hash into the filename itself (`<slug>-<hash6>.yaml`) so file paths are silently unique by construction across branches, and adds slug-friendly lookup tooling so users don't need to remember hex hashes.

### Added

- `docs/spec-ids-multi-dev.md` — external-adopter guide. Covers identifier layers, the no-CLI invocation flow, six lookup scenarios (just-made, partial slug, recent, exact slug, exact id, project activity), three concurrency scenarios (different slugs, same slug simultaneous, same cwd repeated), legacy F-NNN coexistence, and the do-not-override-id guidance.
- `clad_list_features` MCP tool — new `slugSubstring` (case-insensitive contains-match) + `sort: 'alphabetical' | 'recent'` options. "Recent" ranks by `spec/features/<...>.yaml` mtime newest-first.
- `clad_get_feature` MCP tool — now accepts `id` OR `slug`. When a slug matches multiple features, the response carries a `matches` array; the single-match case returns the bare feature for backward compatibility.
- 4 new unit tests on the MCP tool surface (slugSubstring filter, sort=recent shape, slug lookup, missing-arg error).
- `spec/features/F-085.yaml` — "Hash filename + slug-friendly lookup + multi-dev guide" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/spec/new.ts` `createFeature` — filename layout changed from `<slug>.yaml` to `<slug>-<hash6>.yaml` where `<hash6>` is the id's 6-char tail. Two simultaneous calls with the same slug now produce **two distinct files** instead of throwing. Throw remains only for the 1/16M hash-coincidence case (caller can retry).
- `tests/spec/new.test.ts` — "rejects when the <slug>.yaml already exists" case removed; replaced with "two consecutive calls with the same slug produce two distinct files (different hashes)".
- `MINIMAL_SPEC` fixture in `tests/serve/server.test.ts` — added `slug:` fields so the new slug-substring filter is exercised by integration tests.

### Notes

- 559 + 4 new tests = **563/563** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 84 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- The semantic conflict (two contributors picking the same slug) is no longer a `createFeature` failure — it's a `SLUG_CONFLICT` detector finding surfaced on the next `clad check --strict`, with human resolution. File-level uniqueness is by construction; semantic intent stays a human decision.
- v0.3.11 plan: `tests/integration/multi-dev-merge.test.ts` — git-worktree simulation that drives the whole loop (two concurrent contributors → merge → drift detector reports no false positive on file path, but raises SLUG_CONFLICT when slug coincides).

## [0.3.9] — 2026-05-20 — Multi-developer-safe spec ID system (F-084)

**Phase 1 of the multi-dev ID safety arc.** Two contributors creating new features simultaneously on separate branches used to collide on `spec/features/F-084.yaml` (same filename) and `AC-259` (globally sequential). This patch introduces a slug-filename + content-hash-id model that makes concurrent feature creation collision-safe by construction.

### Added

- `src/spec/new.ts` — internal `createFeature({slug, title?, status?, cwd?})` helper. Writes `spec/features/<slug>.yaml` with `id: F-<6-hex-hash>` where the hash bundles slug + OS user + hostname + ms timestamp + hrtime so two simultaneous invocations produce different ids by construction. Validates slug shape (`^[a-z0-9]([a-z0-9-]{0,62}[a-z0-9])?$`); rejects when the file already exists.
- `src/serve/server.ts` — new MCP tool **`clad_create_feature(slug, title?, status?)`** that calls `createFeature`. **No `clad spec new` CLI verb by design** — the user never types a shell command, the host LLM invokes the MCP tool in response to natural-language requests like "add a feature for login-flow".
- Three new drift detectors:
  - `SLUG_CONFLICT` — two features sharing a slug → error.
  - `ID_COLLISION` — two features sharing an id → error (catches the 1/16M hash coincidence and legacy hand-typed duplicates).
  - `AC_DUPLICATE_WITHIN_FEATURE` — same AC id appearing twice inside one feature → error. AC ids are now **feature-scoped**, so `F-001.AC-001` and `F-002.AC-001` coexist freely; only intra-feature duplicates trip the detector.
- 39 new unit tests covering `createFeature` (12), slug-conflict (4), id-collision (5), ac-duplicate-within-feature (6), `clad_create_feature` MCP tool (2). Tests pass: 520 + 39 = **559/559**.
- `spec/features/F-084.yaml` — "Multi-developer-safe spec ID system" (7 ACs, status `done`). First cladding feature authored with a slug-filename and slug field.

### Changed

- `src/spec/schema.json` — `id` regex widened from `^F-\d{3,}$` to `^F-(\d{3,}|[a-f0-9]{6,})$` so both legacy F-NNN and new F-<hash> validate. Same widening for `depends_on` and `superseded_by` references. New optional `slug` field with kebab-case regex.
- `src/stages/detectors/index.ts` — `allDetectors` now lists 23 detectors (20 → 23).
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `ironclad.current.detectors` bumped `20/20` → `23/23` so `HARNESS_INTEGRITY` count check stays green.

### Notes

- 559/559 vitest pass; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 83 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- Legacy `F-001 ~ F-083` files and their global `AC-001 ~ AC-258` numbering are untouched. Two models coexist; new features use the new model, old features keep the old.
- The path forward (per the approved plan): v0.3.10 adds the external-user guide doc, v0.3.11 adds a git-worktree-based integration test that simulates two concurrent contributors. v0.4.0 universal generator stays deferred.

## [0.3.8] — 2026-05-20 — Claude Code external-host dogfood report + cross-host parity (F-083)

**Second external-host verification.** Pairs with the v0.3.7 Gemini CLI report so the multi-host claim now rests on two-host evidence, not single-host coincidence. The same four MCP tools round-trip with the same output shape on both hosts.

### Added

- `docs/dogfood/claude-code-2026-05-20.md` — dated dogfood report for Claude Code `2.1.145` running cladding `v0.3.6+`. Same checklist as the Gemini report; all 6 surfaces ✅, 0 cladding-side issues.
- Documents the headless-mode invocation pattern: `--allowedTools mcp__cladding__<tool>` + prompt piped via stdin (the auto-mode classifier blocks `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and `--allowedTools` as nargs+ swallows a positional prompt).
- States cross-host parity as a verified claim — same 4 MCP tools return the same output shape on Gemini CLI and Claude Code, proving `clad serve` is genuinely host-agnostic.
- Documents the OpenAI Codex CLI deferral honestly: `which codex → not found` on the verifier machine; the cladding-side artifacts (`plugins/codex/` + 11 skills) are present and `HARNESS_INTEGRITY` validates them on every `clad check --strict`, so the cladding side is verification-ready and only host-side execution waits on Codex CLI install.
- `spec/features/F-083.yaml` — "Claude Code external-host dogfood report" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 520/520 vitest pass; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 82 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- **0 cladding code changes** triggered by the verification — multi-host plugin rollout holds across two hosts without follow-up.
- Predicate for v0.4.0 generator (drift incident across hosts) — not triggered.
- v0.3.9 plan: Codex CLI dogfood report once the CLI is installed; cycle 3 of the external-host evidence collection.

## [0.3.7] — 2026-05-20 — Gemini CLI external-host dogfood report (F-082)

**First external-host verification of the multi-host plugin rollout.** v0.3.0 → v0.3.6 shipped cladding as a first-class plugin on three agentic CLIs and added the audit detectors; this patch is the first *evidence* that the rollout actually works end-to-end against a real external host.

### Added

- `docs/dogfood/gemini-cli-2026-05-20.md` — dated dogfood report for Gemini CLI `0.42.0` running cladding `v0.3.6`. Sections:
  - **Environment** — host version, auth model (Google account, free tier), install paths.
  - **Setup steps** — `npm link` + symlink commands reproducible by any reviewer.
  - **Checklist results** — 7 surfaces verified (extension load · MCP server auto-spawn · 3 MCP tool calls · persona prompt fetch · 6 skill TOMLs); every surface ✅.
  - **Issues found** — cladding-side: 0. Host-side observations (ripgrep fallback, YOLO mode) are unrelated to cladding.
  - **What this proves / does NOT prove** — explicit scope boundary (host-bound F-049 AC-091 verified · `clad drive` sampling end-to-end NOT yet verified).
  - **Reproduction recipe** — three `gemini -p` invocations a reviewer can replay.
- `spec/features/F-082.yaml` — "Gemini CLI external-host dogfood report" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 520/520 vitest pass; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 81 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- **0 cladding code changes** triggered by this verification. The multi-host rollout (v0.3.1 → v0.3.6) holds against an external host without follow-up.
- Predicate for v0.4.0 generator (drift incident) — not triggered: the verification found no manifest drift.
- v0.3.8 plan: Claude Code + Codex dogfood reports as cycle 2 of the external-host evidence collection.

## [0.3.6] — 2026-05-19 — SKILL.md → TOML build-time transpile for Gemini (F-081)

**Post-rollout audit, cycle 3 of 3 (final).** v0.3.3 shipped Gemini CLI commands as six hand-authored TOML files; the canonical sources (`skills/<verb>/SKILL.md`) and the TOML mirrors could drift if a verb description got updated in one place but not the other. This patch makes the SKILL.md the single source of truth and the TOMLs build-generated.

### Added

- `scripts/build-plugin.mjs` — new Phase C transpiles each `skills/<verb>/SKILL.md` into `plugins/gemini-cli/commands/<verb>.toml`:
  - YAML frontmatter `description` → TOML `description = "..."` (basic string with `\\` + `\"` escapes; apostrophes pass through).
  - SKILL.md body → TOML `prompt = '''...'''` (literal multi-line — backticks, backslashes, and other markdown punctuation pass through unaltered).
  - Fallback: if the body literally contains `'''`, switch to `prompt = """..."""` with backslash + double-quote escapes (none of cladding's current bodies trigger this, but the fallback exists for future authoring).
- `plugins/gemini-cli/commands/README.md` — AUTO-GENERATED sentinel pointing at `skills/<verb>/SKILL.md` as the canonical source. Rewritten on every build.
- `spec/features/F-081.yaml` — "SKILL.md → TOML build-time transpile" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `plugins/gemini-cli/commands/{sync,check,panel,drive,init,serve}.toml` — now regenerated from the canonical SKILL.md sources rather than hand-authored. The visible content is essentially the same (description and body wording lift verbatim from SKILL.md); the difference is who owns the file.
- Build pipeline: `npm run build:plugin` now runs all three transpile phases (Claude Code mirror → Codex mirror → Gemini transpile) in one pass. Same canonical sources feed all three host plugin layouts.

### Notes

- 520/520 vitest pass (no test changes in this release); lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 80 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- **v0.3.x cleanup is now complete.** v0.3.4 closed the docs/help-text inaccuracies, v0.3.5 added the version-drift detector, v0.3.6 closes the SKILL.md ↔ TOML drift surface. The universal generator (v0.4.0, predicate-gated) is no longer urgent — three hand-crafted manifests are stable and the only previous drift surface (Gemini TOML) is now SSoT-driven.
- v0.4.0 predicate (from plan): one of (a) new host plugin spec added → 4 host scenario justifies generalization, or (b) actual drift incident in the 3 current manifests → re-prioritize.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-05-19 — HARNESS_INTEGRITY · multi-host manifest schema + version drift (F-080)

**Post-rollout audit, cycle 2 of 3.** The original `HARNESS_INTEGRITY` detector (v0.2.4) guarded one invariant — that `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `current.detectors` numerator matched the file count under `src/stages/detectors/`. The multi-host rollout (v0.3.1 → v0.3.3) added two more manifests; this patch extends the detector so all three manifests stay in lockstep.

### Added

- `src/stages/detectors/harness-integrity.ts` — two new check layers on top of the original detector-count check:
  - **Per-host manifest schema**: validates `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (requires `name` + `version`), `plugins/codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` (requires `name` + `version` + `description`), and `plugins/gemini-cli/gemini-extension.json` (requires `name` + `version`). Missing required fields → per-host `error` finding. Malformed JSON → `warn`.
  - **Cross-manifest version drift**: reads `package.json` `version` as baseline and compares to each host manifest. Any mismatch → per-host `error` finding naming the offending version and the baseline. Skipped silently when `package.json` is absent (detector stays a soft validator on non-cladding directories).
- `tests/stages/harness-integrity.test.ts` — 11 new tests across two new describe blocks (per-host schema · cross-manifest version drift). Covers: missing required fields per host, JSON parse failure, host manifest absent, version drift in each host, simultaneous drift in two hosts, version check skipped when `package.json` missing.
- `spec/features/F-080.yaml` — "HARNESS_INTEGRITY · multi-host manifest schema + version drift" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 509 + 11 new tests = **520/520** passing; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 79 features; bundle 1.1 MB.
- The original detector-count invariant (v0.2.4) is intact — same severity ladder, same trigger conditions. The two new layers are additive: when `package.json` and the three host manifests are absent (e.g. a fresh repo or a non-cladding directory), the detector silently passes.
- This closes the most impactful audit gap: a future release can't ship with `package.json` bumped but a host manifest forgotten — the drift detector now fails fast with `clad check --strict`.
- v0.3.6 plan: SKILL.md → TOML build-time transpile for Gemini (F-081). After that, v0.3.x cleanup is done.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-19 — CLI text + docs cleanup (F-079)

**Post-rollout audit, cycle 1 of 3.** v0.3.3 finished the three-host plugin rollout; an audit caught three documentation/help-text issues that pre-dated v0.3.0 or were inaccurate at v0.3.3 ship time. This patch fixes them without touching code logic.

### Changed

- `src/cli/clad.ts` — `clad drive` description rewritten. The old line claimed "LLM dispatch arrives with F-049 in v0.2"; F-049 has been done since v0.3.0 and the loop has dispatched through MCP sampling or AnthropicTransport ever since. New description names the real behaviour: specialist + reviewer persona dispatch, L1 gates, anti-self-cert barrier, evidence recording.
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — `clad serve` JSDoc + subcommand description: removed the version-stamped `(v0.2.24)` annotation so `--help` output stays evergreen. CHANGELOG.md remains the SSoT for which release introduced which verb.
- `plugins/gemini-cli/GEMINI.md` — "API key fallback is supported" corrected. The `gemini` slot in `SDK_REGISTRY` is reserved but the SDK body is not yet implemented in v0.3.x; the doc now states this explicitly rather than promising a fallback that doesn't exist.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — v0.3.3 entry's authentication note updated for the same reason.

### Added

- `spec/features/F-079.yaml` — "CLI text + docs cleanup" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 509/509 vitest pass; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green at 78 features.
- Historical version references in source comments (e.g. "v0.2.19 ships the mock body via MockTransport") are intentionally kept — they document a factual sequence of events. Only user-facing surfaces (CLI help, plugin manifest docs) were evergreen-edited.
- v0.3.5 plan: extend `HARNESS_INTEGRITY` detector to cover all three host manifests + cross-manifest version consistency.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-19 — Gemini CLI extension (F-078)

**Phase 3 of the multi-host plugin rollout.** Adds the Gemini CLI extension under `plugins/gemini-cli/`. Cladding is now installable as a first-class plugin/extension on all three major agentic CLIs: Claude Code (v0.3.1), Codex (v0.3.2), Gemini CLI (this release).

### Added

- `plugins/gemini-cli/gemini-extension.json` — Gemini extension manifest with `name`, `version`, `description`, `contextFileName=GEMINI.md`, and an `mcpServers` map that registers `clad serve` as a stdio MCP server. Loaded automatically when the extension is installed.
- `plugins/gemini-cli/commands/{sync,check,panel,drive,init,serve}.toml` — six verbs as Gemini CLI custom commands in TOML format. Each TOML has `description` (shown in `/help`) and `prompt` (sent to the model when the user invokes `/cladding:<verb>`).
- `plugins/gemini-cli/GEMINI.md` — context file loaded into Gemini's session from start. Lists the six commands, summarises the five personas (orchestrator · librarian · reviewer · observability · specialists), and states the no-API-key invariant explicitly.
- `spec/features/F-078.yaml` — "Gemini CLI extension manifest" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 509/509 vitest pass; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green; bundle rebuilds at 1.1 MB.
- Gemini CLI's TOML command format differs from Claude Code / Codex (both use Markdown with YAML frontmatter). v0.3.3 keeps the TOML files hand-authored alongside the canonical Markdown sources; the v0.4.0 generator (Phase 4) will transpile from a single universal source into each host's native format.
- **Authentication**: extension uses Gemini CLI's Google account login (60 req/min · 1000/day free tier). The `gemini` SDK adapter slot is reserved in `src/adapters/index.ts` `SDK_REGISTRY` but the SDK body is not yet implemented in v0.3.3 — direct-SDK dispatch is not a shipped fallback. The no-API-key invariant (F-049 AC-091) is intact across all three host plugins.
- v0.4.0 plan: `clad plugin build` universal generator (minor bump) — collapse the three hand-crafted manifests into a single source-of-truth that transpiles per host.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-19 — Codex plugin manifest (F-077)

**Phase 2 of the multi-host plugin rollout.** v0.3.1 promoted cladding to a real Claude Code plugin; this patch adds the OpenAI Codex CLI / IDE plugin manifest under `plugins/codex/`. Same single-source canonical files (`src/agents/` + `skills/`) feed both manifests, so a verb or persona authored once shows up in both host plugin catalogs.

### Added

- `plugins/codex/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — Codex plugin manifest. Declares `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`, `license`, `skills`, `mcpServers`, plus an `interface` block (`displayName`, `category`, `capabilities`) per the OpenAI Codex plugin spec.
- `plugins/codex/.mcp.json` — registers `clad serve` as a stdio MCP server so Codex auto-launches it whenever the plugin is enabled.
- `plugins/codex/skills/{sync,check,panel,drive,init,serve,orchestrator,librarian,reviewer,observability,specialists}/SKILL.md` — 11 skills (6 verbs + 5 personas) generated by `scripts/build-plugin.mjs` from the canonical sources.
- `spec/features/F-077.yaml` — "Codex plugin manifest" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `scripts/build-plugin.mjs` — now generates two host plugin layouts in one pass:
  - **Claude Code** mirror (Phase A, F-076) at the repo root — unchanged behaviour
  - **Codex** mirror (Phase B, F-077) at `plugins/codex/skills/` — copies repo-root `skills/<verb>/SKILL.md` verbatim and re-emits `src/agents/<persona>.md` as `<persona>/SKILL.md`. Warns when a persona file lacks the `description` YAML frontmatter field (Codex requires it) but continues the build.

### Notes

- 509/509 vitest pass; lint clean; typecheck clean; drift-green; bundle rebuilds at 1.1 MB.
- The build is now multi-host-aware in one command: `npm run build:plugin` regenerates both Claude Code's `agents/` mirror and Codex's `plugins/codex/skills/` mirror from the same single source.
- v0.3.3 plan: Phase 3 — Gemini CLI extension (`plugins/gemini-cli/`).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-19 — Claude Code plugin formalization (F-076)

**Phase 1 of the multi-host plugin rollout.** cladding has been on the Anthropic Claude Code plugin marketplace as a *declaration-only* surface — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` carried metadata but the plugin manifest's `skills/`, `agents/`, and `.mcp.json` were missing. This patch promotes cladding to a *real* Claude Code plugin: install it, and you get six namespaced skills (`/cladding:sync`, `/cladding:check`, `/cladding:panel`, `/cladding:drive`, `/cladding:init`, `/cladding:serve`), the five persona agents, and an auto-launched MCP server — no manual configuration.

### Added

- `.mcp.json` at the plugin root — registers cladding's MCP server (`clad serve`) so Claude Code auto-launches it whenever the plugin is enabled. This is what closes the loop: host adapters route through MCP sampling the moment the plugin loads, no `clad serve` command from the user needed.
- `skills/{sync,check,panel,drive,init,serve}/SKILL.md` — six verbs as Claude Code skills with YAML frontmatter `description` for model invocation. Each body explains what the verb does and when to use it.
- `agents/{orchestrator,librarian,reviewer,observability,specialists}.md` — the five persona files mirrored from `src/agents/` so Claude Code's agent picker surfaces them. The mirror is produced by `scripts/build-plugin.mjs` and committed to git.
- `scripts/build-plugin.mjs` — one-way copy from `src/agents/` (canonical source) to `agents/` (plugin manifest mirror). Drops an AUTO-GENERATED header in `agents/README.md` so hand-edits are caught.
- `package.json` — new `build:plugin` script; `build` now chains `build.mjs && build-plugin.mjs`.
- `spec/features/F-076.yaml` — "Claude Code plugin formalization" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- `commands/clad.md` remains for backward compatibility — users on an older Claude Code release that prefers `commands/<name>.md` over `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` still get `/cladding:clad <verb>`. The modern surface coexists rather than replaces.
- After installing the plugin via `/plugin install cladding`, calling `/cladding:check` invokes the same drift suite as `clad check` from the shell — same code path, different surface.
- The auto-launched MCP server means the host adapters (`generic-mcp`, `claude-code`) flip from Mock to McpSamplingTransport without user intervention; cladding's drive loop dispatches real LLM calls through Claude Code's sampling channel from the first invocation.
- v0.3.2 plan: Phase 2 — Codex plugin (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) under `plugins/codex/`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-19 — First minor — host MCP transport · live audit · F-049 done

**The v0.2.19 → v0.2.26 thread closes here.** F-049 (the agent dispatch + runtime orchestration feature whose Mock host bodies have been the project's biggest known deferral since v0.2.0) is now `done`. cladding ships a real transport for both modes:

- **Host mode** — `clad serve` boots an MCP server; the host adapters route LLM dispatch through the connected MCP client via the SDK's `createMessage` sampling request. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Cline, or any future MCP-aware host.
- **SDK mode** — `claude-anthropic` calls the Anthropic API directly (opt-in via `agent.mode = sdk`).

The minor bump is the spec status flip — every code line that backs F-049 has been merging through develop since v0.2.19. No new code in this release, by design.

### Changed

- `spec/features/F-049.yaml` — `status: in_progress` → `status: done`. AC-092 rewritten to reference the four real implementations (F-069, F-073, F-074, F-075) instead of the original "v0.2.0 mock, v0.3.0 real" placeholder; evidence_refs now point at the concrete modules.
- Version bumped to **0.3.0** in `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `src/cli/clad.ts`, `src/serve/server.ts` default advertised version.

### Cumulative contributions (the eight patches this release bundles)

| Version | Feature | Contribution |
|---|---|---|
| 0.2.19 | F-068 | Transport interface extraction — adapter / body split. |
| 0.2.20 | F-069 | AnthropicTransport — first real-LLM dispatch (SDK path). |
| 0.2.21 | F-070 | Drive-loop integration test against AnthropicTransport. |
| 0.2.22 | F-071 | Transport-specific halt classes (`TRANSPORT_AUTH_FAILED` · `_RATE_LIMITED` · `_NETWORK`). |
| 0.2.23 | F-072 | Pre-flight transport health check at drive loop start. |
| 0.2.24 | F-073 | `clad serve` MCP server scaffold — tools / resources / persona prompts. |
| 0.2.25 | F-074 | `McpSamplingTransport` + live audit notification (`notifications/resources/updated`). |
| 0.2.26 | F-075 | Host adapter routing through MCP sampling · bundle minified to 1.1 MB · SECURITY.md MCP invariants. |

### Notes

- 509/509 vitest pass at the v0.2.26 tip; this release adds no test changes.
- `node bin/clad check --strict` drift-green at 75 features.
- BREAKING: none. Every change is additive — code that ran on v0.2.x still runs on v0.3.0 with identical behaviour (Mock fallback when no MCP server is registered).
- Marketplace + npm publish are explicitly out of scope for this release (memory: `marketplace_timing`, `npm publish` deferral).

## [0.2.26] — 2026-05-19 — Host adapter MCP routing + release readiness sweep (F-075)

**Phase B' of the v0.3.0 host-MCP transport thread — the closing patch before declaring F-049 done.** Wires the v0.2.25 building blocks into the actual host adapter dispatch path, then runs a release-readiness audit (bundle minify, security documentation, README sync) so v0.3.0 is a 30-minute version bump rather than a fresh integration push.

### Added

- `src/adapters/host/sampling-context.ts` — process-scoped registry for the active sampling-capable server. `setHostMcpServer(server)` returns a disposer that respects later registrations (won't clobber); `getHostMcpServer()` returns the current registration; `clearHostMcpServerForTesting()` for test isolation.
- `src/cli/clad.ts` `runServeCommand` — registers the freshly-built server in the sampling context before connecting stdio, so the moment a client connects the host adapters route through MCP sampling.
- `tests/adapters/sampling-context.test.ts` — 6 unit tests covering registration, disposer behaviour (including the "later registration wins" rule), null-clear semantics, and the test-only reset hook.
- `tests/adapters/host-parity.test.ts` — 5 new tests under "host adapter MCP routing (F-075)" covering: claudeCodeAdapter routes via sampling, genericMcpAdapter routes via sampling, clearing the registration falls back to Mock on the next dispatch, replacing the registered server re-allocates the cached Sampling transport, healthCheck stays `ready: true` under sampling.
- `spec/features/F-075.yaml` — "Host adapter MCP routing + release readiness sweep" (6 ACs, status `done`).
- `SECURITY.md` — new "MCP server (`clad serve`) — invariants" section: no arbitrary shell execution from MCP tools · read-only by default · sampling responses pass through anti-self-cert · audit notifications are advisory.

### Changed

- `src/adapters/host/claude-code.ts` + `src/adapters/host/generic-mcp.ts` — `invokeAgent` and `healthCheck` now go through an `activeTransport()` helper that returns a cached `McpSamplingTransport` (host-tagged id, `mcp-sampling:claude-code` / `mcp-sampling:generic-mcp`) when a server is registered, or the Mock fallback when not. Per-dispatch decision so a server registered after import still routes correctly.
- `scripts/build.mjs` — `esbuild` now runs with `minify: true`. **Bundle size: 2.4 MB → 1.1 MB (55 % reduction).** No source-map drop, no syntax transforms; the bundle stays a single ESM file readable enough for diagnostic spelunking.
- `src/adapters/host/transport.ts` `SamplingCapableServer` — `messages` widened from `ReadonlyArray` to `Array` and `role` widened to `'user' | 'assistant'` so the SDK's real `Server.createMessage` is assignment-compatible with the interface.
- `README.md` + `README.ko.md` — status line bumped to v0.2.26 · 498/498 tests, adds `clad serve` MCP server with live audit stream, McpSamplingTransport routing, minified bundle size; feature count 73 → 75.
- `docs/multi-provider-roadmap.md` — adapter matrix entries flipped from "planned" to "live (v0.2.26)"; new "What every v0.2.x release contributed" table summarising the F-068 → F-075 thread.
- `src/serve/server.ts` `buildServer` — default `version` advertised to clients bumped to `0.2.26`.

### Notes

- 509/509 vitest pass; `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm run lint` clean; `node bin/clad check --strict` drift-green.
- **Bundle 55 % smaller** without losing any feature — the MCP SDK cost from v0.2.24 is now amortized.
- Host adapter routing is the architectural closing of the v0.2.19 → v0.2.26 thread: F-049's AC-092 ("v0.3.0 introduces the MCP server mode that real Claude Code subagent and MCP-client roundtrips dispatch through") is satisfied today; the v0.3.0 declaration is purely a version bump + spec status flip + release flow.
- v0.3.0 plan: `spec/features/F-049.yaml` status `in_progress` → `done`, minor bump 0.2.26 → 0.3.0, main release flow (tag, gh release create). **Requires user confirmation** for the minor bump.

## [0.2.25] — 2026-05-19 — McpSamplingTransport + live audit notification (F-074)

**Phase B of the v0.3.0 host-MCP transport thread.** v0.2.24 shipped the read surface of `clad serve`; this patch adds the bidirectional pieces — a Transport that dispatches LLM calls via MCP sampling, and a notification path that lets clients live-tail the audit log.

### Added

- `src/adapters/host/transport.ts` — `McpSamplingTransport` (real-host body) + `SamplingCapableServer` interface. The transport takes any server with a `createMessage(params)` method and forwards persona body + feature shard as a sampling request to the connected MCP client. Reply maps to AgentResult with host-tagged identity, 200-char-truncated summary, empty mutations (structured mutations land later), and notes containing model + stopReason.
- `src/hitl/audit.ts` — `subscribeAudit(handler)` observer hook returning a dispose callback. Handlers fire after the file write; exceptions are swallowed so a misbehaving observer cannot corrupt the audit chain.
- `src/serve/server.ts` — `registerAuditNotifier` subscribes an observer that filters by cwd and emits `notifications/resources/updated` for `cladding://audit` when a new evidence entry lands. `registerSubscribeHandlers` wires no-op `resources/subscribe` + `resources/unsubscribe` request handlers (the high-level McpServer wrapper doesn't include them by default).
- McpServer constructor now declares `capabilities: {resources: {subscribe: true}}` so connected clients can subscribe to the audit resource.
- `tests/adapters/transport.test.ts` — 10 unit tests for McpSamplingTransport (id override, system-prompt forwarding, AgentResult shape mapping, 200-char truncation, non-text reply fallback, guardrail interpolation, ready() probe, maxTokens override, error propagation).
- `tests/hitl/audit.test.ts` — 9 tests for the audit observer hook (single observer, multiple observers, dispose, throwing observer doesn't break the chain, file readable from inside the observer, clear-for-testing).
- `tests/serve/audit-notify.test.ts` — 3 in-process integration tests using `Client.setNotificationHandler(ResourceUpdatedNotificationSchema, ...)` to verify: subscribed client receives the notification when evidence lands · evidence for a different cwd does NOT cross-talk · re-reading the audit resource after the notification surfaces the new entry.
- `spec/features/F-074.yaml` — "McpSamplingTransport + live audit notification" (6 ACs, status `done`).

### Fixed

- `src/serve/server.ts` — `cladding://events` and `cladding://audit` resource paths were `events.log` / `audit.log` but the writers (`src/events/log.ts`, `src/hitl/audit.ts`) use the `.jsonl` suffix. Aligned both sides to `events.log.jsonl` / `audit.log.jsonl`. This bug existed in v0.2.24 — surfaced when audit-notify integration tests started reading actual content.

### Notes

- 476 + new tests = **498/498** passing; lint clean; `node bin/clad check --strict` drift-green.
- McpSamplingTransport is exported but not wired into `generic-mcp` / `claude-code` adapters yet — that wiring (env detection + adapter routing) is the next sub-patch. v0.2.25 ships the building block; the routing decision waits until v0.2.26 release readiness sweep so the bundle-size cost (already paid by MCP SDK) is amortized across both pieces.
- The live-audit chain is fully functional **today** for any caller of `appendEvidence` — including future drive-loop iterations dispatching through McpSamplingTransport.
- v0.2.26 plan: release readiness sweep — esbuild `minify: true` (predicted 30~40% bundle reduction), SECURITY.md MCP section (no arbitrary shell exec invariant), README sync (capability lines for host MCP transport + live audit stream).

## [0.2.24] — 2026-05-19 — MCP server scaffold · `clad serve` (F-073)

**Phase A of the v0.3.0 host-MCP transport thread.** `clad serve` boots cladding as an MCP server over stdio so any MCP-aware host (Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, Cline) can consume cladding's tools, resources, and persona prompts. Phase A ships the read surface only; sampling-based dispatch (the transport the drive loop will use) lands in v0.2.25.

### Added

- `src/serve/server.ts` — `buildServer(opts)` factory returning a fully-configured McpServer. The function is transport-agnostic so the production CLI path and the in-process test pair share the same wiring.
- `src/cli/clad.ts` — new `clad serve` verb. Lazy-imports `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` so the cold-start cost stays on the path that uses it.
- Four MCP tools: `clad_list_features` (with `statusFilter` arg), `clad_get_feature` (typed `isError` on unknown id), `clad_run_check` (delegates to `runDrift`, surfaces `isError` on fail), `clad_get_events` (tails `.cladding/events.log`, configurable `limit`).
- Three MCP resources: `cladding://spec` (aggregated spec, JSON), `cladding://events` (NDJSON event log), `cladding://audit` (NDJSON audit log). Returns empty text when the file is absent.
- Five MCP prompts — one per persona (`orchestrator`, `librarian`, `reviewer`, `observability`, `specialists`). Each accepts an optional `featureId` arg that gets interpolated into the persona body.
- `tests/serve/server.test.ts` — 13 integration tests using an in-process `InMemoryTransport.createLinkedPair()` to drive a real `Client` against the real `McpServer`. Covers tool listing, resource reading, prompt fetching, status filter, unknown-id error path, and an empty-log fallback.
- `tests/cli/clad.test.ts` — CLI plumbing test for `runServeCommand` (MCP server build + stdio transport instantiation, both mocked).
- `package.json` — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` ^1.29.0 + `zod` (transitive) added to dependencies.
- `spec/features/F-073.yaml` — "MCP server (`clad serve`) — read surface" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 462 + new tests = **476/476** passing; lint clean; `node bin/clad check --strict` drift-green.
- Bundle size grew from ~1.3 MB to ~2.4 MB because `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and its `zod` dependency get included. The dynamic import in `runServeCommand` keeps the cost on the `serve` path — `clad sync` / `clad check` / `clad drive` cold-starts are unaffected.
- v0.2.25 plan: `McpSamplingTransport` — sampling-based transport that the drive loop's host adapters use to round-trip LLM requests through the connected MCP host. Pairs with this server in-process for the integration test.

## [0.2.23] — 2026-05-19 — Pre-flight transport health check (F-072)

The drive loop used to discover a missing API key (or any unhealthy adapter) only after the first feature iteration: pre-flight check runs once at startup, the loop fails fast at iteration 0, and the user sees an actionable halt class instead of a wasted dispatch attempt.

### Added

- `src/drive/loop.ts` — pre-flight `adapter.healthCheck()` call between spec-load and the iteration loop. If the adapter reports `ready: false`, the reason string is routed through `classifyTransportError` (introduced in v0.2.22) so the halt lands in the most specific class — `TRANSPORT_AUTH_FAILED` for credential problems, `TRANSPORT_RATE_LIMITED` for pre-flight rate-limit, `TRANSPORT_NETWORK` for unreachable hosts, `LLM_UNAVAILABLE` as catch-all. Halt detail begins with `pre-flight health check failed:`.
- `DriveOptions.skipHealthCheck` — opt-out used by unit tests that stub `runAgent` and never reach a real adapter dispatch. Production CLI path leaves it `false`.
- `spec/features/F-072.yaml` — "Pre-flight transport health check in drive loop" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/drive/halt.ts` `classifyTransportError` — extended AUTH detection to also match the lowercased phrases `api key` and `api_key`, so AnthropicTransport's "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var is not set" pre-flight reason classifies as `TRANSPORT_AUTH_FAILED` instead of falling through to `LLM_UNAVAILABLE`.
- `tests/drive/loop.test.ts` — added a healthy-stub `selectAdapter` mock plus an F-072 sub-describe that exercises the four pre-flight paths (auth · rate limit · network · ready=true) and the `skipHealthCheck: true` bypass.

### Notes

- 462/462 vitest pass; `npm run lint` clean; `node bin/clad check --strict` drift-green.
- The pre-flight check costs one local function call when healthy and zero network IO for both host and SDK adapters in the happy path — AnthropicTransport's `ready()` only checks for the env var presence.
- v0.3.0 plan (substep 5): declare F-049 done (mock removed in favour of the SDK path), bump minor, release.

## [0.2.22] — 2026-05-19 — Transport-specific halt classes (F-071)

**Substep 4 of the v0.3.0 path.** The drive loop used to flatten every transport failure into `LLM_UNAVAILABLE`. With real-LLM dispatch live since v0.2.20, that's no longer actionable — users need to know whether a halt came from a bad API key, a rate limit, or a network blip. v0.2.22 introduces three transport-specific halt classes and routes the loop's catch blocks through a single classifier.

### Added

- `src/drive/halt.ts` — three new `HaltClass` members: `TRANSPORT_AUTH_FAILED` (401 / 403 / invalid API key), `TRANSPORT_RATE_LIMITED` (429 / quota / too many requests), `TRANSPORT_NETWORK` (ENOENT / ECONNREFUSED / ECONNRESET / ETIMEDOUT / ENOTFOUND or matching phrases). `LLM_UNAVAILABLE` stays as the catch-all.
- `src/drive/halt.ts` — `classifyTransportError(err: unknown): HaltClass`. Reads the error message (case-insensitive) plus the `code` field on `NodeJS.ErrnoException`. Auth precedes rate-limit precedes network in the check order, so an ambiguous error lands in the most user-actionable bucket.
- `src/ui/softShell.ts` — `HALT_MESSAGES` entries for the three new classes ("Stopped — agent rejected the credentials. Check your API key." / "Stopped — agent is rate-limited. Try again after the cooldown." / "Stopped — could not reach the agent over the network.").
- `tests/drive/halt.test.ts` — classifier unit tests across all four buckets (~20 cases), including non-Error throws and precedence ordering.
- `tests/integration/loop-real-transport.test.ts` — the "transport throw" case is split into four: 401 → AUTH_FAILED, 429 → RATE_LIMITED, ECONNREFUSED → NETWORK, unknown phrase → LLM_UNAVAILABLE.
- `spec/features/F-071.yaml` — "Transport-specific halt classes for real-LLM dispatch failures" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/drive/loop.ts` — both specialist and reviewer dispatch catch blocks now call `classifyTransportError(err)` instead of hardcoding `class: 'LLM_UNAVAILABLE'`. The reviewer block still routes `ReviewerIdentityCollisionError` to `HUMAN_REQUIRED` (unchanged contract).
- `tests/ui/softShell.test.ts` — the every-class round-trip test now iterates 13 classes (10 + 3 new).

### Notes

- 426 + new tests = **all passing**; `node bin/clad check --strict` stays drift-green.
- The classifier is intentionally pattern-based (HTTP status prefixes + SDK phrases + `ErrnoException` codes) — no SDK-specific coupling. New transports (OpenAI, Google, …) get the same classification for free as long as their errors carry conventional shapes.
- v0.3.0 plan (substep 5): declare F-049 done (mock removed in favour of the SDK path), bump minor, release.

## [0.2.21] — 2026-05-19 — Drive-loop integration test against AnthropicTransport (F-070)

**Substep 3 of the v0.3.0 path.** Wires the v0.2.19 Transport interface and the v0.2.20 AnthropicTransport into a drive-loop end-to-end integration test. Proves the loop's halt-class chain — `ALL_FEATURES_DONE`, `HUMAN_REQUIRED` via reviewer-identity barrier, `LLM_UNAVAILABLE` on transport throw — works against real-LLM-shape data, not just mock placeholders.

### Added

- `tests/integration/loop-real-transport.test.ts` — 3 integration tests:
  - Happy path: loop dispatches through `selectAdapter → claudeAnthropicAdapter → AnthropicTransport` with a stubbed clientFactory, reaches `ALL_FEATURES_DONE`
  - Identity collision: forced same-identity from both specialist and reviewer dispatches → `HUMAN_REQUIRED` (F-049 AC-086 contract preserved against real-shape data)
  - Auth fail: transport throws "401: invalid x-api-key" → `LLM_UNAVAILABLE` halt with original message in detail
- `spec/features/F-070.yaml` — "Drive-loop integration test against AnthropicTransport" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/adapters/sdk/anthropic.ts` — added `setDefaultTransportForTesting(t)` test-only seam. The module-level default Transport is now lazy and swappable via this function. Production code MUST NOT call it; integration tests use it to inject a stubbed Transport without monkey-patching the adapter.

### Notes

- 423 + 3 new tests = **426 / 426** passing.
- `node bin/clad check --strict` stays drift-green.
- `setDefaultTransportForTesting` is the first test-only export cladding ships; documented with a "Production code MUST NOT call this" comment.
- v0.2.22 plan: introduce transport-specific halt classes (TRANSPORT_AUTH_FAILED, TRANSPORT_RATE_LIMITED, TRANSPORT_NETWORK) that the loop maps to instead of the generic `LLM_UNAVAILABLE`. This gives users actionable error categories.

## [0.2.20] — 2026-05-19 — AnthropicSdkTransport · first real-LLM dispatch (F-069)

**Substep 2 of the v0.3.0 path.** Cladding ships its first real-LLM Transport: `AnthropicTransport`, which dispatches via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to the Anthropic API directly. Opt-in via `agent.mode = sdk` + `agent.name = claude-anthropic` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var. Default cladding stays on the host-bound MockTransport — no behaviour change for existing setups.

Host-mode real transport (the claude-code subagent dispatch path) still depends on the `clad serve` MCP server, which is queued for a later substep. v0.2.20 unlocks real LLM calls today through the SDK path, while the MCP path matures separately.

### Added

- `src/adapters/sdk/anthropic.ts` — `AnthropicTransport` (real-LLM body) + `claudeAnthropicAdapter` (AgentAdapter wrapping it). Uses the `clientFactory` injection seam so tests substitute an in-memory client and no network call fires during CI.
- `tests/adapters/anthropic.test.ts` — 11 unit tests covering id format, ready() with/without API key, invoke() throw on missing key, AgentResult shape, system/user message formatting, client caching, 200-char summary truncation, model/maxTokens override, stop_reason surfacing.
- `package.json` — `@anthropic-ai/sdk` added to `dependencies`.
- `spec/features/F-069.yaml` — "AnthropicSdkTransport — first real-LLM dispatch path" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/adapters/index.ts` — new `SDK_REGISTRY` with the `claude-anthropic` entry; `selectAdapter()` routes `mode: sdk` to `SDK_REGISTRY` before falling through to `generic-mcp`. The "SDK adapters not yet implemented" fallback comment is updated.
- `tests/adapters/index.test.ts` — the `sdk mode → falls back to generic-mcp` test is replaced by two tests: `sdk + claude-anthropic → SDK adapter` and `sdk + unknown name → still falls back to generic-mcp`.

### Notes

- 411 + 12 new tests = **423 / 423** passing.
- `node bin/clad check --strict` stays drift-green; coverage unchanged.
- The SDK adapter's body is real; the surrounding cladding workflow (selector, drive loop, parity tests) is the same. End-to-end real LLM dispatch works today with `CLADDING_AGENT_MODE=sdk CLADDING_AGENT_NAME=claude-anthropic ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=… node bin/clad drive`.
- v0.2.21 plan: drive-loop integration test that runs end-to-end against AnthropicTransport with a stubbed client (no network), proving the loop dispatches → reviewer barrier → UAT chain through real-shape (not mock) data.

## [0.2.19] — 2026-05-19 — Transport interface extraction · v0.3.0 substep 1 (F-068)

First step toward the v0.3.0 F-049 real Claude Code dispatch. Splits each host adapter into two layers: the AgentAdapter (the contract `drive/agent.ts` sees) and the Transport (the swappable body that crosses the host boundary). v0.2.19 ships the MockTransport implementation only; v0.2.20 replaces selected adapters' MockTransport with a real body without touching the AgentAdapter object.

**No behaviour change.** Pure structural refactor — the same mock results land in the drive loop today as before.

### Added

- `src/adapters/host/transport.ts` — Transport interface (`id`, `invoke`, `ready`) + `MockTransport` implementation. Both real bodies in v0.2.20+ will implement the same interface.
- `tests/adapters/transport.test.ts` — 7 unit tests covering MockTransport's observable behaviour.
- `spec/features/F-068.yaml` — "Transport interface extraction" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `src/adapters/host/claude-code.ts` — composes a `MockTransport` instance and delegates `invokeAgent` / `healthCheck` to it. Inline `mockResult()` removed.
- `src/adapters/host/generic-mcp.ts` — same refactor as claude-code.

### Notes

- 404 + 7 new tests = **411 / 411** passing.
- `node bin/clad check --strict` stays green; coverage unchanged.
- v0.2.20 plan: introduce `ClaudeCodeTransport` (real subagent dispatch) and `McpTransport` (real MCP roundtrip) alongside MockTransport. Adapter objects pick the right Transport based on runtime detection. Behaviour change isolated to the Transport file.

## [0.2.18] — 2026-05-19 — MISSING_TESTS warn → error (F-067)

**Lock-in patch**. The v0.2.4 honesty cleanup brought cladding's self-spec from 56 empty `status: done` ACs down to zero. v0.2.18 converts that one-time achievement into a permanent invariant: the `MISSING_TESTS` drift detector's default severity is promoted from `warn` to `error`. Shipping a new done AC without `test_refs` or `evidence_refs` now fails `clad check` outright — not just under `--strict`.

### Changed

- `src/stages/detectors/missing-tests.ts` — finding severity `warn` → `error`. Module header updated with the v0.2.18 rationale (the promotion was held until self-spec had zero empty done ACs, which v0.2.4 delivered).
- `tests/stages/missing-tests.test.ts` — assertion updated from `'warn'` to `'error'`; test name updated; header comment updated.
- `src/stages/detectors/README.md` — catalog row #7, status-policy table, and AC-evidence-taxonomy section all reflect the new error severity with a "(promoted from warn in v0.2.18)" annotation.

### Added

- `spec/features/F-067.yaml` — "MISSING_TESTS severity promoted warn → error" (3 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- `node bin/clad check` (default mode) on cladding's own self-spec stays drift-green because all 66 features × their ACs already declare evidence (v0.2.4 cleanup).
- 404 / 404 tests stay green. No coverage change.
- For user projects that haven't completed an equivalent cleanup, this is a breaking change in CI signal — the same situation that previously emitted warns now emits errors. Mitigation: declare evidence for every done AC, or temporarily downgrade the feature to `status: in_progress` until evidence is ready.

## [0.2.17] — 2026-05-19 — Differentiation evidence into docs (F-066)

Surfaces the 2026-05-19 controlled A/B/C benchmark (event-sourcing store, 22 ACs + 8 traps) inside cladding's own docs so external readers can find it without access to the maintainer's local cladding-abc workspace. The headline result — **vanilla 2/8 (25%) accidental trap catch vs cladding 8/8 (100%) explicit** — is now linked from `README.md`, `README.ko.md`, and cited in `GOVERNANCE.md` §5 (v1.0 graduation criteria).

### Added

- `docs/benchmarks/event-store-trap-catch.md` — full synthesis: 8-axis comparison, trap-by-trap matrix, plugin-invocation note, cumulative cells 07/09 table.
- `docs/benchmarks/event-store-spec-with-traps.md` — the shared problem definition (22 normal ACs + 8 intentional ambiguities).
- `spec/features/F-066.yaml` — "Differentiation evidence — surface cell 09 benchmark in cladding's docs" (3 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `README.md` + `README.ko.md` — new **Evidence** section between Levels and Status & roadmap. Summarises the trap-catch result and links to the full document.
- `GOVERNANCE.md` §5 — appended a **Differentiation evidence** subsection citing the benchmark with explicit "one data point, not proof" framing. The four v1.0 graduation conditions stay unchanged.

### Notes

- This patch is documentation-only. No code change. 404/404 tests stay green. Coverage and drift unchanged.
- The benchmark is reproducible from the published spec + the published trap list; the per-variant source is in the maintainer's local cladding-abc workspace and can be republished on request.
- The "Differentiation evidence" framing is deliberate: one cell at one complexity level is signal, not proof. The v1.0 falsifications-registry condition (GOVERNANCE.md §5.4) gates the wider claim.

## [0.2.16] — 2026-05-19 — `src/` layout adoption (F-065)

**Layout refactor**, no behaviour change. Every first-party code dir now lives under a single `src/` root: `src/{adapters · agents · cli · drive · events · hitl · optimizer · router · spec · stages · ui}`. Spec data (`features/`, `scenarios/`, `architecture.yaml`) stays at the project root because user projects keep their data at that path; `schema.json` moves into `src/spec/` because it travels with the code that reads it.

### Changed (mechanical)

- Source dirs moved: `adapters/` `agents/` `cli/` `drive/` `events/` `hitl/` `optimizer/` `router/` `stages/` `ui/` → `src/<name>/`
- Spec runtime moved: `spec/{cli,ears,load,parse,types,validate}.ts` + `spec/schema.json` → `src/spec/`
- Spec data unchanged: `spec/{features/,scenarios/,architecture.yaml}` stay at root
- `tests/**/*.ts` — 126 import + vi.mock + dynamic-import paths gained `src/` prefix
- `spec/features/*.yaml` — 336 module / evidence_refs path references gained `src/` prefix (where they point at code)
- `conformance/runner.ts` — 16 stage / hitl imports updated
- `vitest.config.ts` — coverage `include` collapses from 11 glob patterns to `src/**/*.ts`
- `package.json` scripts — 13 entries updated (`tsx src/stages/X.ts` etc)
- `scripts/build.mjs` — entry `cli/clad.ts` → `src/cli/clad.ts`; schema source `src/spec/schema.json`
- `bin/clad` — tsx fallback path `cli/clad.ts` → `src/cli/clad.ts`
- `src/stages/detectors/unmapped-artifact.ts` — scan glob `stages/**` → `src/stages/**`
- `src/stages/detectors/harness-integrity.ts` — count glob `stages/detectors/*.ts` → `src/stages/detectors/*.ts`
- `src/stages/detectors/meta-integrity.ts` — schema lookup `spec/schema.json` → `src/spec/schema.json`

### Added

- `spec/features/F-065.yaml` — "src/ layout — move all code dirs under one source root" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 404 / 404 tests pass; `node bin/clad check --strict` is green; line coverage stays at **93.89%** (unchanged from v0.2.15 — the move doesn't add or remove tested code).
- Why the split: spec/ at root holds **data** that users' own projects also keep at root; `src/spec/` holds **code** that travels with cladding. `loadSpec(cwd)` still reads `${cwd}/spec.yaml` and `${cwd}/spec/features/*.yaml` — unchanged for users.
- Why `conformance/` stays at root (parallel to `tests/`, not under `src/`): it's a test/integration harness, not production code. `npm run conformance` is a separate entry point — the bundle doesn't include `conformance/runner.ts`. The `FIXTURE_REFERENCE_INVALID` detector reads `${cwd}/conformance/fixtures.yaml` for both cladding-self and user projects, so the path must stay symmetric across both.
- Doc sweep: 18 `.md` files updated for the new layout (63 inline-backtick path substitutions + 3 markdown link targets + 1 prose `tsx` invocation). README level-history entries that describe past versions are preserved verbatim.
- This is the second meta-refactor of the v0.2.x cycle (after the v0.2.13 coverage scope widening). After v0.2.16 the repo root is materially tidier: 11 code dirs collapse into 1.

## [0.2.15] — 2026-05-19 — Final coverage closure · every source dir ≥ 90% (F-064)

**Milestone**: every one of the 11 first-party source dirs (`adapters · agents · cli · drive · events · hitl · optimizer · router · spec · stages · ui`) is now at ≥ 90% line coverage. Project line coverage rises from **87.67% → 93.89%** (+6.22pp) under the widened scope from v0.2.13.

The cli chapter, which opened in v0.2.13 at 37.4% (init only), now closes at **92.7%**. The adapter chapter rises from 75% to **97.5%**.

### Changed

- `cli/clad.ts` — refactored to expose every verb's handler as a named export (`runInitCommand`, `runWorkCommand`, `runDriveCommand`, `runSyncCommand`, `runCheckCommand`, `runPanelCommand`, `runRouteCommand`), plus a `createProgram()` factory that returns the wired commander `Command`. Top-level `program.parse()` is now guarded by an `isCliEntry` check that fires when the module is the bundled entry **or** the directly-executed source. Importing from a test no longer touches `process.argv`. Behaviour-preserving — `node bin/clad <verb>` works identically to before.

### Added

- `tests/cli/clad.test.ts` — 18 tests covering every handler (init / work / drive / sync / check / panel / route) including exit codes, option forwarding, spec-absent fallbacks, `--strict` drift forwarding, `--internal` stage codes, `--json` raw output, `UNCAUGHT_ERROR` exit-1 mapping, and the `createProgram()` factory's 7-verb registration. Uses a record-only `process.exit` mock so the try/catch in `runSyncCommand` does not eat the recorded code.
- `tests/adapters/index.test.ts` — 12 tests covering the resolution chain (env priority / config priority / auto-detect / malformed config / partial agent / unknown host fallback / sdk-mode fallback) for both `resolveSelection` and `selectAdapter`.
- `spec/features/F-064.yaml` — "Final coverage closure — every source dir ≥ 90% lines" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per dir at v0.2.15 baseline (line %):
  - events: 100, hitl: 100, optimizer: 100, router: 100, ui: 100
  - spec: 98.3, **adapters: 97.5** (was 75), **cli: 92.7** (was 37.4), agents: 93.3, stages: 92.9, drive: 90.6
- 30 new tests bring the suite to **404 / 404 passing** (374 prior).
- `clad check --strict` confirmed green (93.89% > 70% floor with headroom).

### Coverage push — closing arc

| Batch | Targets | Line coverage | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.2.5 baseline | 3 detectors | 26.8% | narrow |
| v0.2.9 (detectors closed) | 20 det | 63.49% | narrow |
| v0.2.12 (stages closed) | 20 det + 12 stages | 93.32% | narrow |
| v0.2.13 (scope widened) | + cli/init + cli/benchmark | 74.42% | **wide** |
| v0.2.14 (5 chapters closed) | + drive · agents · events · optimizer · ui | 87.67% | wide |
| **v0.2.15 (final closure)** | **+ cli/clad + adapters/index** | **93.89%** | wide |

## [0.2.14] — 2026-05-19 — Coverage sweep · 5 chapters closed in one batch (F-063)

Massive sweep that closes **five remaining 0%-coverage chapters** at once: `drive`, `agents`, `events`, `optimizer`, `ui`. Project line coverage rises from **74.42% → 87.67%** (+13.25pp) under the widened scope introduced in v0.2.13.

### Added

- `tests/drive/loop.test.ts` — 12 tests covering every halt class (UNCAUGHT_ERROR / ALL_FEATURES_DONE / BLOCKED_FEATURE / LLM_UNAVAILABLE / HUMAN_REQUIRED / MAX_ITERATIONS) plus happy path with single + paired-feature dependency runs. Heavy-mock approach (`vi.mock` for spec/load, agents/loader, drive/agent, stage runners, events, audit) keeps the suite deterministic.
- `tests/agents/loader.test.ts` — 8 tests covering frontmatter parse / missing / unterminated / unknown-capability filter / missing-file throw / cache reuse / cache clear.
- `tests/events/log.test.ts` — 8 tests covering newEvent shape, directory auto-creation, round-trip, absent / empty / whitespace-only log, multi-append order, idempotent directory creation.
- `tests/optimizer/preamble.test.ts` — 7 tests covering "You are X agent" stripping / "# Persona" heading / "Your job is to" / blank-run collapsing / no-preamble pass-through / custom patterns / default-pattern non-empty.
- `tests/optimizer/tail.test.ts` — 7 tests covering no-cut / cut-middle / boundary / default-arg / empty input / elision-count formula.
- `tests/ui/pulse.test.ts` — 8 tests covering every PulseKind glyph, TTY-vs-non-TTY ANSI rendering, detail-string indent, empty-detail trim.
- `tests/ui/panel.test.ts` — 8 tests covering L4 cell derivation (audit empty / human pass / tool-only guard fail), internal-vs-default mode, title fallback, default cwd/opts.
- `spec/features/F-063.yaml` — "Coverage sweep — drive · agents · events · optimizer · ui all covered" (6 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per dir at v0.2.14 baseline (line %):
  - hitl: 100, router: 100, **events: 100** (was 0), **optimizer: 100** (was 60.7), **ui: 100** (was 39), spec: 98.3, **agents: 93.3** (was 0), stages: 92.9, **drive: 90.6** (was 21.9), adapters: 75, cli: 37.4
- 58 new tests bring the suite to **374 / 374 passing** (316 prior).
- `clad check --strict` confirmed green at 87.67% (well above the 70% floor).

### Coverage push — cumulative arc

| Batch | Targets | Line coverage | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.2.5 baseline | 3 detectors | 26.8% | narrow (stages + spec) |
| v0.2.9 (detector chapter closed) | 20 detectors | 63.49% | narrow |
| v0.2.12 (stage chapter closed) | 20 det + 12 stages | 93.32% | narrow |
| v0.2.13 (scope widened) | + cli/init + cli/benchmark | **74.42%** | **wide (11 dirs)** |
| **v0.2.14 (5 chapters closed in one batch)** | + drive · agents · events · optimizer · ui | **87.67%** | wide |

### What's still open

Under the widened scope:

- `cli/clad.ts` (commander entry) — 0%. Needs subprocess or handler-extraction approach.
- `adapters/index.ts` — 62.5%. Some branches of the auto-detection logic uncovered.

That's the entire remaining gap on the source tree, post-sweep.

## [0.2.13] — 2026-05-19 — cli test batch 1 + widened coverage scope (F-062)

Opens the **cli chapter** with a honest twist: the coverage measurement scope is widened from `{stages, spec}` to every first-party source dir (cli, drive, optimizer, adapters, router, ui, hitl, events, agents). The headline coverage number now tracks the whole codebase, not just the two chapters closed in v0.2.9 / v0.2.12. **Pre-v0.2.13 percentages remain valid for the narrow scope they were measured against, but are not directly comparable to v0.2.13+ numbers.**

Under the widened scope, project line coverage stands at **74.42%** — well above the 70% floor, so `clad check --strict` still passes drift.

### Changed

- `vitest.config.ts` — coverage `include` widened to 11 first-party source dirs (was 2). The `exclude` list switches to a glob that catches every `*.test.ts` at any depth, rather than the previous stage-specific glob.
- `cli/benchmark.ts` — refactored for testability: `approxTokens` and `benchmark` are now exported, and CLI bootstrap code (`if (!featureId) process.exit(2)` …) is wrapped in an `isCliEntry` guard. Matches the pattern used by every other module in the tree.

### Added

- `tests/cli/init.test.ts` — three new branch tests bring `cli/init.ts` to **100% line coverage**: explicit `projectName` override, `.gitignore` without a trailing newline, `.gitignore` created from scratch.
- `tests/cli/benchmark.test.ts` — 8 tests covering `approxTokens` (empty / 4-char / partial / 400-char) plus `benchmark` (single feature / multi-feature reduction / sharded spec load / reduction-percent formula). Brings `cli/benchmark.ts` to **57.9% line coverage** (CLI bootstrap block remains uncovered — by design).
- `spec/features/F-062.yaml` — "cli test batch 1 + widened coverage scope" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- 11 new tests bring the suite to **316 / 316 passing** (305 prior).
- Per-dir coverage at v0.2.13 baseline (line %):
  - hitl: 100, router: 100, spec: 98.3, stages: 92.9, adapters: 75, optimizer: 60.7, ui: 39, cli: 37.4, drive: 21.9, agents: 0, events: 0
- Visible 0% dirs (`agents/loader.ts`, `drive/loop.ts`, `events/log.ts`, `optimizer/{preamble,tail}.ts`, `ui/{panel,pulse}.ts`, `cli/clad.ts`) are batch-2+ candidates.
- `clad check --strict` confirmed green under the widened scope (74.42% > 70% floor).

## [0.2.12] — 2026-05-19 — Stage runner chapter closed · every stage covered (F-061)

**Milestone**: every one of the 12 Iron Law stage runners (stage_1.1 through stage_4.2) now carries a dedicated unit-test file at ≥ 75% line coverage. The stage-runner chapter that opened with v0.2.10 is closed. Combined with the detector chapter closed in v0.2.9, **every business-logic module cladding ships now has dedicated unit-test coverage**.

Project line coverage rises from **84.23% → 93.32%** (+9.1pp), crossing the 90% milestone. Total cumulative gain since v0.2.5 baseline: **26.8% → 93.32% (+66.5pp)** across seven batches.

### Added

- `tests/stages/perf.test.ts` — 8 tests covering the npm-script delegate pattern (unknown / script-missing / exit 0 / non-zero / ENOENT / non-ENOENT throw / null-exit / explicit non-npm override).
- `tests/stages/visual.test.ts` — 8 tests mirroring the perf pattern.
- `tests/stages/uat.test.ts` — 7 tests covering spec-absent / audit-empty / human-pass-satisfies / tool-only-fails / human-note-does-not-satisfy / status-filter / multi-feature paths via real `appendEvidence` writes.
- `spec/features/F-061.yaml` — "Stage runner tests batch 3 — every stage covered" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per targeted stage (v8 reporter, JSON summary):
  - `stages/perf.ts`: 88.5% lines · 92.6% branches
  - `stages/visual.ts`: 88.5% lines · 92.6% branches
  - `stages/uat.ts`: 85.7% lines · 93.3% branches
- 23 new tests bring the suite to **305 / 305 passing** (282 prior).
- The remaining ~7% of source-tree coverage lives in `cli/*`, `optimizer/*`, scan helpers — separate threads beyond the stage/detector chapters.

### Coverage push — the full arc

| Batch | Targets | Line coverage | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.2.5 baseline | 3 detectors | 26.8% | — |
| v0.2.6 (detector batch 1) | 8 detectors | 36.36% | +9.5pp |
| v0.2.7 (detector batch 2) | 10 detectors | 49% | +12.6pp |
| v0.2.8 (detector batch 3) | 15 detectors | 58.66% | +9.7pp |
| v0.2.9 (detector batch 4) | 20 detectors (chapter closed) | 63.49% | +4.8pp |
| v0.2.10 (stage batch 1) | 20 det + 4 stages | 72.58% | +9.1pp |
| v0.2.11 (stage batch 2) | 20 det + 9 stages | 84.23% | +11.6pp |
| **v0.2.12 (stage batch 3)** | **20 det + 12 stages (both chapters closed)** | **93.32%** | **+9.1pp** |

## [0.2.11] — 2026-05-19 — Stage runner tests batch 2 (F-060)

Continues the stage-runner coverage thread opened by v0.2.10. Five more stage runners gain dedicated unit tests using the established patterns: detector-adapter stages (`arch`, `secret`) mock the underlying detector; polyglot stages (`unit`, `cov`, `smoke`) mock `execaSync`. Project line coverage rises from **72.58% → 84.23%** (+11.65pp).

### Added

- `tests/stages/arch.test.ts` — 6 tests covering the detector-adapter shape (no findings / info-only / single error / multi-error / mixed severity / opts forwarding).
- `tests/stages/secret.test.ts` — 6 tests mirroring the arch pattern.
- `tests/stages/unit.test.ts` — 6 tests covering the polyglot toolchain pattern (unknown / override / exit 0 / non-zero / stderr-present-or-absent / null-exit).
- `tests/stages/cov.test.ts` — 6 tests mirroring the unit pattern.
- `tests/stages/smoke.test.ts` — 8 tests covering the richer branch tree (unknown / npm-script-missing / present-exit-0 / non-zero / ENOENT / non-ENOENT throw / null-exit / explicit override).
- `spec/features/F-060.yaml` — "Stage runner tests batch 2" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per targeted stage (v8 reporter, JSON summary):
  - `stages/arch.ts`: 75% lines · 88.9% branches
  - `stages/secret.ts`: 75% lines · 88.9% branches
  - `stages/unit.ts`: 85.7% lines · 90.9% branches
  - `stages/cov.ts`: 85.7% lines · 90.9% branches
  - `stages/smoke.ts`: 88.5% lines · 92.6% branches
- The 75% line floor on `arch.ts` / `secret.ts` reflects their tighter source — the uncovered lines are the `isCliEntry` blocks at the bottom of each file, identical to the v0.2.10 pattern.
- 32 new tests bring the suite to **282 / 282 passing** (250 prior).
- 3 stage runners remain (`perf.ts`, `visual.ts`, `uat.ts`) — batch 3 candidates.

## [0.2.10] — 2026-05-19 — Stage runner tests batch 1 · **70% coverage floor cleared** (F-059)

**Milestone**: project line coverage crosses the 70% floor. `clad check --strict` no longer emits the COVERAGE_DROP warn that has been the last `--strict`-mode blocker since v0.2.2. The five-batch coverage push that began at v0.2.5 (26.8% baseline) closes at **72.58%**.

Four stage runners gain dedicated unit tests using the `vi.mock('execa')` pattern proven in v0.2.9: `type` (stage_1.1), `lint` (stage_1.2), `commit` (stage_1.4), and `audit` (stage_4.1). The first three are subprocess-bound polyglot stages; `audit` is pure read-only.

### Added

- `tests/stages/type.test.ts` — 6 tests covering unknown-language / explicit override / exit 0 / non-zero exit / stderr present-or-absent / null-exit-default-1.
- `tests/stages/lint.test.ts` — 6 tests mirroring the type-runner pattern (the stage shape is identical; only the gate differs).
- `tests/stages/commit.test.ts` — 6 tests covering clean tree / dirty tree / non-git / git non-zero with empty stderr / ENOENT / non-ENOENT throw.
- `tests/stages/audit.test.ts` — 5 tests using real `appendEvidence` writes to exercise audit-log empty / clean human evidence / tool-only guard-fail / multi-AC fail / mixed human-and-tool paths.
- `spec/features/F-059.yaml` — "Stage runner tests batch 1 — 70% coverage floor cleared" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per targeted stage (v8 reporter, JSON summary):
  - `stages/type.ts`: 85.7% lines · 90.9% branches
  - `stages/lint.ts`: 85.7% lines · 90.9% branches
  - `stages/commit.ts`: 84.2% lines · 83.3% branches
  - `stages/audit.ts`: 80% lines · 90% branches
- Per-stage line coverage hits ~80–86% rather than 100%. The uncovered lines are the `isCliEntry` blocks at the bottom of each file — runtime-only CLI bootstraps that aren't reachable from in-process tests.
- 23 new tests bring the suite to **250 / 250 passing** (227 prior).
- `clad check --strict` confirmed green on drift after this batch.

### Cumulative coverage progression (5-batch push)

| Batch | Detectors / Stages covered | Line coverage | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.2.5 baseline | 3 detectors | 26.8% | — |
| v0.2.6 (detector batch 1) | 8 detectors | 36.36% | +9.5pp |
| v0.2.7 (detector batch 2) | 10 detectors | 49% | +12.6pp |
| v0.2.8 (detector batch 3) | 15 detectors | 58.66% | +9.7pp |
| v0.2.9 (detector batch 4) | 20 detectors | 63.49% | +4.8pp |
| **v0.2.10 (stage batch 1)** | 20 det + 4 stages | **72.58%** | **+9.1pp** |

### What's still open

- 8 stage runners remain (`arch`, `cov`, `secret`, `unit`, `smoke`, `perf`, `visual`, `uat`). Coverage will continue to rise as each batch lands — the 70% floor is now a sustained property, not a finish line.

## [0.2.9] — 2026-05-19 — Detector catalog 20/20 at 100% line coverage (F-058)

The final batch of the detector-coverage thread. The last two detectors — `HARDCODED_SECRET` and `ARCHITECTURE_VIOLATION`, both subprocess-bound — gain unit tests using `vi.mock('execa')` to exercise every branch deterministically. **Result: every one of the 20 registered drift detectors (19 Ironclad + 1 cladding extension) now has a dedicated `tests/stages/*.test.ts` file at 100% line coverage.**

Project line coverage rises from **58.66% → 63.49%** (+4.83pp). Cumulative gain across four batches: **+36.7pp** from the v0.2.5 baseline (26.8% → 63.49%). The detector chapter is now closed.

### Added

- `tests/stages/hardcoded-secret.test.ts` — 7 tests covering no-toolchain-gate / exit 0 / non-zero exit / ENOENT / non-ENOENT throw / stdout-only / no-output exit-code fallback. Uses `vi.mock('execa')` so the suite stays deterministic; real-binary coverage lives in `conformance/runner.ts` (stage_1.6 fixtures).
- `tests/stages/architecture-violation.test.ts` — 7 tests mirroring the HARDCODED_SECRET pattern. Real-binary coverage lives in stage_1.5 fixtures.
- `spec/features/F-058.yaml` — "Detector unit tests batch 4 (final 2 + every detector at 100% line coverage)" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per targeted detector (v8 reporter, JSON summary):
  - `hardcoded-secret.ts`: 100% lines · 81.25% branches
  - `architecture-violation.ts`: 100% lines · 81.25% branches
- 14 new tests bring the suite to **227 / 227 passing** (213 prior).
- **Milestone**: detector catalog 20/20 at 100% line coverage. Every drift detector cladding ships now has a dedicated unit-test file. Branch coverage averages ~95% across the catalog — the remaining gaps are nullish defaults and other defensive guards that don't materially change behaviour.
- The `COVERAGE_DROP` warn under `--strict` is still present (63.49% < 70% floor). The detector chapter is closed; v0.2.10+ pivots to **stage runner tests** (`stages/{type,lint,commit,cov,smoke,perf,visual,audit,uat,unit}.ts` all sit at 0% today — the biggest absolute gap left).

### Cumulative coverage progression

| Batch | Detectors covered | Line coverage | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.2.5 baseline | 3/20 | 26.8% | — |
| v0.2.6 (batch 1) | 8/20 | 36.36% | +9.5pp |
| v0.2.7 (batch 2) | 10/20 | 49% | +12.6pp |
| v0.2.8 (batch 3) | 15/20 | 58.66% | +9.7pp |
| v0.2.9 (batch 4) | **20/20** | **63.49%** | +4.8pp |

## [0.2.8] — 2026-05-19 — Detector unit tests batch 3 (F-057)

Continuation of the v0.2.6/7 coverage push. Five more detectors gain dedicated `tests/stages/*.test.ts` files at **100% line coverage**. Overall project line coverage rises from **49% → 58.66%** (+9.7pp). After three batches, **15 of 20 detectors are covered at 100%**; cumulative gain from v0.2.5 baseline is **+31.9pp**.

### Added

- `tests/stages/coverage-drop.test.ts` — 6 tests covering artifact absent / coverage above/at/below floor / malformed JSON / missing lines field.
- `tests/stages/performance-drift.test.ts` — 7 tests covering both-files absent / one-side missing / metric regression / within tolerance / multi-metric / division-by-zero guard / malformed JSON.
- `tests/stages/evidence-mismatch.test.ts` — 5 tests covering audit log absent / artifact present / artifact missing / no-artifact note evidence / multi-missing via real `appendEvidence` writes.
- `tests/stages/stale-evidence.test.ts` — 5 tests covering audit log absent / fresh / stale (120 days) / mixed-age filtering / unparseable timestamp with controlled ISO stamps.
- `tests/stages/reference-integrity.test.ts` — 7 tests covering depends_on / superseded_by / scenarios.features cross-references (resolved + broken), multi-broken, and spec-absent.
- `spec/features/F-057.yaml` — "Detector unit tests batch 3" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per targeted detector (v8 reporter, JSON summary):
  - `coverage-drop.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
  - `performance-drift.ts`: 100% lines · 81.8% branches
  - `evidence-mismatch.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
  - `stale-evidence.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
  - `reference-integrity.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
- 30 new tests bring the suite to **213 / 213 passing** (183 prior).
- After this batch, **3 detectors lack dedicated tests**: `hardcoded-secret` (subprocess: `npx secretlint`), `architecture-violation` (subprocess: `madge`), and any future cladding extensions. Both subprocess detectors need richer fixture setup or a stubbed `execaSync` — that's batch 4.
- The `COVERAGE_DROP` warn under `--strict` is still present (58.66% < 70% floor). One more detector batch plus stage-runner tests should clear it.

## [0.2.7] — 2026-05-19 — Detector unit tests batch 2 (F-056)

Continuation of the v0.2.6 coverage push. Five more detectors gain dedicated `tests/stages/*.test.ts` files, each reaching **100% line coverage** on the detector source. Overall project line coverage rises from **36.36% → 49%** in this batch (+12.6pp). After two batches the suite has covered 10 of the 20 detectors at 100%.

### Added

- `tests/stages/convention-drift.test.ts` — 7 tests covering line-header / block-header / bare-module / non-existent / non-TS / multi-feature / spec-absent paths.
- `tests/stages/stale-tests.test.ts` — 7 tests using controlled `utimesSync` stamps to exercise the 30-day mtime boundary, no-tests, no-source, multi-stale, and spec-absent paths.
- `tests/stages/stale-specification.test.ts` — 6 tests covering the three lifecycle-metadata branches (archived_at + status mismatch / superseded_by without archived_at / archived status with surviving modules) plus healthy and spec-absent baselines.
- `tests/stages/harness-integrity.test.ts` — 6 tests covering matching count / divergent count / malformed declaration / plugin.json absent / detectors field absent / index.ts exclusion.
- `tests/stages/meta-integrity.test.ts` — 6 tests covering valid schema / missing required key / missing property declaration / malformed JSON / absent schema / unsupported spec version.
- `spec/features/F-056.yaml` — "Detector unit tests batch 2" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per targeted detector (v8 reporter, JSON summary):
  - `convention-drift.ts`: 100% lines · 90.9% branches
  - `stale-tests.ts`: 100% lines · 80% branches
  - `stale-specification.ts`: 100% lines · 93.3% branches
  - `harness-integrity.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
  - `meta-integrity.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
- 32 new tests bring the suite to **183 / 183 passing** (151 prior).
- 7 detectors still lack dedicated tests after this batch: `coverage-drop`, `performance-drift`, `evidence-mismatch`, `stale-evidence`, `hardcoded-secret`, `architecture-violation`, `reference-integrity`. The first four are batch-3 candidates (read-only file probing); the last three need richer subprocess / fixture setup.
- The `COVERAGE_DROP` warn under `--strict` is still present (49% < 70% floor). One more batch should close most of the remainder.

## [0.2.6] — 2026-05-19 — Detector unit tests batch 1 (F-055)

After v0.2.5 the only remaining `clad check --strict` failure was the pre-existing `COVERAGE_DROP warn` (line coverage 26.8% < 70% floor). v0.2.6 starts the honest path to clearing it — real test coverage, not a lower floor. Five detectors gain dedicated `tests/stages/*.test.ts` files, each reaching **100% line coverage** on the detector source. Overall project line coverage rises from **26.8% → 36.36%** in one batch.

### Added

- `tests/stages/unmapped-artifact.test.ts` — 6 tests covering happy / unclaimed / out-of-scope / multi-feature / archived / spec-absent paths.
- `tests/stages/missing-implementation.test.ts` — 7 tests covering present / missing / mixed / no-modules / archived / spec-absent / multi-feature paths.
- `tests/stages/status-drift.test.ts` — 8 tests covering the four lifecycle states (done / in_progress / planned / archived) × module presence, plus the no-modules and spec-absent edge cases.
- `tests/stages/ac-drift.test.ts` — 7 tests covering the structural floor (text-only / EARS-only / neither) and the EARS syntactic check (event-pattern misalignment / ubiquitous null condition) plus multi-AC and spec-absent paths.
- `tests/stages/tech-stack-mismatch.test.ts` — 5 tests covering language agreement / disagreement / unknown manifest, manifest-priority chain (package.json beats pyproject.toml), and spec-absent.
- `spec/features/F-055.yaml` — "Detector unit tests batch 1" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- Coverage per targeted detector (v8 reporter, JSON summary):
  - `ac-drift.ts`: 100% lines · 90% branches
  - `missing-implementation.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
  - `status-drift.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
  - `tech-stack-mismatch.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
  - `unmapped-artifact.ts`: 100% lines · 100% branches
- 33 new tests bring the suite to **151 / 151 passing** (118 prior).
- 12 detectors still lack dedicated tests (batch 2 candidates: convention-drift, stale-tests, coverage-drop, performance-drift, evidence-mismatch, stale-evidence, stale-specification, hardcoded-secret, architecture-violation, harness-integrity, reference-integrity, meta-integrity).
- The COVERAGE_DROP warn under `--strict` is still present (36% < 70% floor); cumulative batches will close that gap.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-05-19 — Documentary → runnable promotion batch 1 (F-054)

v0.2.4 introduced 45 documentary fixtures with the explicit promise that future cycles would promote them to runnable conformance entries. v0.2.5 delivers the first batch — 7 documentary fixtures gain real `setup` / `run` bodies in `conformance/runner.ts` and are exercised on every `npm run conformance`. The conformance suite grows from 26/26 to 33/33 matched fixtures.

### Added

- `conformance/runner.ts` — `ExpectedFinding` type and an optional `expectFindings` field on the `Fixture` interface. `runOne` now asserts both `result.pass === expectedPass` AND that every entry in `expectFindings` is present in `result.findings` (with the right detector + severity). Closes the gap where a warn or info finding could not be probed because it does not flip drift's pass/fail.
- 7 runnable fixtures promoted from documentary placeholders:
  - `F-007_AC-011` — Commit stage skip (no `.git`)
  - `F-011_AC-018` — `MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION` info when `spec.yaml` is absent
  - `F-012_AC-020` — `UNMAPPED_ARTIFACT` info when `spec.yaml` is absent
  - `F-013_AC-021` — `TECH_STACK_MISMATCH` warn on language disagreement
  - `F-014_AC-022` — `STATUS_DRIFT` error when a done feature references a missing module
  - `F-014_AC-023` — `STATUS_DRIFT` warn when an in_progress feature has all modules absent
  - `F-019_AC-029` — `AC_DRIFT` error when an AC declares no text and no EARS fields
- `spec/features/F-054.yaml` — "Documentary → runnable promotion (batch 1)" (4 ACs, status `done`).
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — new `conformance.documentary-promoted-batch-1` block records the 7/7 promotion total.

### Changed

- `conformance/fixtures.yaml` — the 7 promoted entries change `kind: documentary` → `kind: runnable`. Descriptions and AC traceability are preserved.
- `tests/conformance/registry.test.ts` — `loadRunnerIds()` regex generalises from `stage_X.Y.{pass,fail}` to also accept `F-NNN_AC-MMM`. Bidirectional sync invariant now covers both naming schemes.

### Notes

- 38 documentary fixtures remain in `conformance/fixtures.yaml` (2 original `missing-implementation` / `missing-tests` plus 36 from v0.2.4). Each is a future batch candidate; promotion order will favour ACs whose setup needs no specialised environment (audit logs, perf baselines, secretlint config).
- `expectFindings` is opt-in. Existing fixtures that only need pass/fail matching are unaffected.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-19 — Fixture registry + 56-AC evidence cleanup (F-053)

v0.2.3 split `test_refs` from `evidence_refs` but left 56 of cladding's own `status: done` ACs declaring neither — `MISSING_TESTS` warned on every one, and `--strict` mode failed loudly. v0.2.4 closes that gap by promoting the `fixture:NAME` label from a free-form string into a validated anchor, then using documentary fixtures plus existing tests and doc artifacts to give every AC a real evidence citation. **Result: `MISSING_TESTS` emits zero findings on cladding's own spec; `--strict` mode no longer fails on AC-evidence drift.**

### Added

- `conformance/fixtures.yaml` — single source of truth for every fixture name the self-spec is allowed to cite via `evidence_refs: [fixture:NAME]`. 26 runnable entries (matching the hardcoded fixtures in `conformance/runner.ts`) plus 45 documentary placeholders for ACs whose verification lives in the source or in a paired AC's test.
- `stages/detectors/fixture-reference.ts` (`FIXTURE_REFERENCE_INVALID`) — 20th detector (cladding extension to the upstream Ironclad 19). Scans every `evidence_refs` / `test_refs` entry that starts with `fixture:` and emits a `warn` finding when the name is absent from `conformance/fixtures.yaml`. Opts out silently when the registry file is missing, so user projects that don't adopt the convention aren't punished.
- `tests/stages/fixture-reference.test.ts` — 8 unit tests covering registered/unregistered citations, documentary kind, non-fixture refs, backward-compat with `test_refs`, missing registry, malformed YAML, and status-blind scanning.
- `tests/conformance/registry.test.ts` — 4 invariants on the SSoT: bidirectional sync with `runner.ts`, every entry declares a `kind`, every entry has a unique name.
- `spec/features/F-053.yaml` — "Fixture registry — validated anchor for evidence_refs labels" (6 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `target.detectors` and `current.detectors` bumped from `19/19` to `20/20`. The 20th is cladding-extension; the Ironclad surface remains 19.
- `stages/detectors/index.ts` — registers `fixtureReference` alongside the upstream 19.
- `stages/detectors/README.md` — catalog row #20 added with a one-paragraph explanation that the cladding-extension diverges from the Ironclad column meanings. The "AC evidence taxonomy" section (added in v0.2.3) is updated to note that `fixture:` citations are now validated.
- `README.md` + `README.ko.md` — headline now reads "3 always-error + 16 conditional + 1 cladding extension" with the 20th detector named.
- `spec/features/F-001.yaml` … `F-047.yaml` — **56 ACs migrated**. 3 wired to existing tests (Bucket B: F-001/AC-002, F-003/AC-005, F-004/AC-006), 10 wired to doc artifacts (Bucket C: agents/*.md, CHANGELOG.md, GOVERNANCE.md, etc.), 43 wired to per-AC documentary fixtures named `F-NNN_AC-MMM` (Bucket A: code-implemented branches without a dedicated test).

### Notes

- The 43 Bucket A entries are honest documentary fixtures, not real conformance tests. Each fixture entry carries the AC's `text` as its `description` so reviewers can grep, and a future cycle (v0.2.5+) can promote individual entries to `kind: runnable` by writing matching setup/run code in `conformance/runner.ts`.
- After this patch, `clad check --strict` still surfaces a pre-existing `COVERAGE_DROP` warn (line coverage 26.8% < 70% floor). That is orthogonal to evidence-drift cleanup; raising coverage is its own cycle.
- `UNTESTED_AC` (the path-resolving sibling detector) remains unchanged — it still only inspects `test_refs`, so the documentary fixtures don't interact with it.

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-19 — `test_refs` / `evidence_refs` split (F-052)

v0.2.2 reframed the detector headline; this patch fixes the *spec data* underneath it. Cladding's own 50-feature spec was burying npm-script names (`self-dogfood:stage:*`), conformance fixture pointers (`fixture:*`), and doc paths (`*.md`, `docs/*`) inside `test_refs` — making `UNTESTED_AC` skip them via a `self-dogfood:` / `fixture:` prefix dance and obscuring which ACs were actually verified by executable code-tests. v0.2.3 introduces a parallel `evidence_refs` field, migrates the 24 mis-categorised refs across 22 ACs, and teaches `MISSING_TESTS` to count either field as satisfying the verification requirement.

### Added

- `acceptance_criterion.evidence_refs` — schema-level sibling of `test_refs` for non-test verification artifacts (npm scripts, conformance fixtures, curated docs/reports). Documented in `spec/schema.json`, typed in `spec/types.ts`, and described under "AC evidence taxonomy" in `stages/detectors/README.md`.
- `tests/stages/missing-tests.test.ts` — 6 unit tests covering the new four-quadrant decision matrix (neither / test_refs-only / evidence_refs-only / both) plus the status=planned skip case and multi-AC independence.
- `spec/features/F-052.yaml` — "test_refs / evidence_refs split — honest AC verification taxonomy" (4 ACs, status `done`).

### Changed

- `stages/detectors/missing-tests.ts` — silent when *either* `test_refs` or `evidence_refs` is non-empty for a `status: done` AC. Both empty still triggers `warn` (escalates to `error` under `--strict`). Detector message now names both fields.
- `spec/features/F-001.yaml` .. `F-051.yaml` — 22 ACs migrated. Every former `test_refs: [self-dogfood:…]` / `[fixture:…]` / `[*.md]` entry now lives under `evidence_refs`. `test_refs` retains only paths matching `tests/**` or `*.test.*`.
- `stages/detectors/README.md` — new "AC evidence taxonomy" section explains the split and which detector inspects which field.

### Notes

- 56 of cladding's own ACs still have neither `test_refs` nor `evidence_refs` (audited 2026-05-19). These trigger `MISSING_TESTS warn` today; closing them is a v0.2.4+ audit that requires per-AC judgement about which evidence kind actually exists. The current patch fixes the *taxonomy*, not the *coverage*.
- `UNTESTED_AC` (the path-resolving detector) is unchanged. It only inspects `test_refs` because its truth condition is "file exists on disk"; `evidence_refs` entries are deliberately out of its scope.
- The `self-dogfood:` / `fixture:` skip prefixes in `untested-ac.ts` are now dead code for cladding's own spec but kept for backward compatibility with user spec.yaml files mid-migration.

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-19 — Detector honesty patch

A 2026-05-19 controlled drift-inject experiment (`cladding-abc/08-drift-inject/`) measured cladding's detector set against four scenarios (UNMAPPED_ARTIFACT, MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION, AC_DRIFT, UNTESTED_AC). The result — 2.5/4 catch rate — surfaced that the "19 detectors" headline oversells the bare metal. This patch corrects the framing without changing default behaviour, and adds an opt-in `--strict` mode that promotes warn-severity drift findings to fail the stage.

### Changed

- `README.md` + `README.ko.md` — the detector set is now described as "3 always-error + 16 conditional", with the severity matrix linked. Replaces the previous undifferentiated "19/19" framing.
- `stages/detectors/README.md` — new "Severity reality vs the 19-detectors headline" section names the 3 confidently always-error detectors (`UNMAPPED_ARTIFACT` · `MISSING_IMPLEMENTATION` · `STATUS_DRIFT`) and groups the 16 conditional detectors by what softens them (status-aware · config-dependent · code-anchor-dependent · warn-only · scoped-scan · environment).

### Added

- `clad check --strict` — drift stage promotes warn findings to errors for that invocation. Suited for CI / pre-publish gates. Default `clad check` behaviour is unchanged.
- `stages/drift.ts` — `runDrift({strict?: boolean})`. When `strict` is true, `report.pass` becomes false on any warn finding (in addition to errors).
- `tests/stages/drift.test.ts` — 4 new cases for the strict mode (warn no-fail default, warn-fail strict, error-fail unchanged in strict, info still ignored).
- `spec/features/F-051.yaml` — "Detector severity policy + opt-in strict mode" (5 ACs, status `done`).

### Notes

- The default drift-stage policy stays warn-as-info (per the upstream Ironclad `iron-law.md stage_1.3` contract). `--strict` is the opt-in escalation.
- Two follow-up paths are deferred to v0.2.3+: (a) promoting `MISSING_TESTS` from warn to error for `done` features once cladding's own spec adds `test_refs` to the remaining ACs; (b) `AC_DRIFT` auto-anchoring via `clad sync` so the existing detector logic catches spec-text rewrites. Both are higher-risk patches that need their own design + safety review.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-19 — F-049 agent dispatch (machinery complete, transport mocked)

This release closes the "machinery" half of F-049 — the agent-adapter contract, the drive-loop dispatch wiring, the two reserved halt classes — and explicitly defers the real Claude Code / MCP transport bodies to v0.3.0. The architectural decision that unlocks the real transports (cladding adopts an MCP server mode, `clad serve`) is recorded in `docs/multi-provider-roadmap.md`; until then the two host adapters return deterministic mock results so the loop, the parity tests, and the halt classes all exercise the right code paths.

### Added

- `adapters/types.ts` — `AgentAdapter` contract (mode · name · capabilities · `invokeAgent` · `healthCheck`), plus `PersonaSpec` / `AgentContext` / `AgentResult` / `AgentMutation` / `Capability` / `HealthStatus`. Matches F-049 AC-085 (least-context payload) and AC-091 (host adapters require no API key).
- `adapters/host/claude-code.ts` — claude-code host adapter, **mock stage**. Detects the runtime via `CLAUDECODE` / `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. Real Claude Code subagent dispatch lands in the third v0.2.0 PR; the surrounding interface is stable.
- `adapters/host/generic-mcp.ts` — generic-mcp host adapter, **mock stage**. Detects MCP runtime via `MCP_TRANSPORT` / `MCP_SERVER_NAME`. Real MCP transport lands in the third v0.2.0 PR.
- `adapters/index.ts` — `selectAdapter(cwd)` + `resolveSelection(cwd)`. Resolution order: env vars (`CLADDING_AGENT_MODE` / `CLADDING_AGENT_NAME`) → `.cladding/config.yaml` (`agent.mode` / `agent.name`) → auto-detect (`claude-code` when inside Claude Code, otherwise `generic-mcp`). Never throws — always returns an adapter.
- `drive/agent.ts` — `runAgent(persona, ctx, opts)` wrapper. Selects the active adapter, invokes it, writes evidence to the audit log, enforces the reviewer-vs-author barrier (F-049 AC-086) via `ReviewerIdentityCollisionError`.
- `agents/loader.ts` — `loadPersona(id, rootDir?)` reads `agents/<id>.md`, parses the YAML frontmatter for `capabilities:`, returns the prose body as the persona prompt. Cached per file path.
- `tests/adapters/host-parity.test.ts` — 6 cases proving `AgentResult` / `Identity` / `mutations` shape is invariant across both host adapters (F-049 AC-090), plus `healthCheck` auto-detect.
- `tests/drive/agent.test.ts` — 3 cases: dispatch records evidence, reviewer-identity collision throws, reviewer hand-off succeeds when identities differ.

### Changed

- `drive/loop.ts` — rewritten as `async function runDriveLoop`. Per iteration: specialist dispatch via `runAgent` → apply mutations → ensureStub fallback → L1 gates (Type / Lint / Arch) → reviewer dispatch (catches `ReviewerIdentityCollisionError` → `HUMAN_REQUIRED` halt) → UAT (`stage_4.2`) gate (lack of human pass on a `done` feature → `HUMAN_REQUIRED` halt). Adapter errors anywhere in the cycle surface as `LLM_UNAVAILABLE` halts. Five of ten halt classes were "WIRED"; two more (`HUMAN_REQUIRED`, `LLM_UNAVAILABLE`) now emit for real, with `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` / `BLOCKED_FEATURE` / `GATE_NO_PROGRESS` still reserved.
- `cli/clad.ts` `drive` — now `await runDriveLoop(...)`. Soft Shell and `--json` outputs unchanged.
- `spec/features/F-049.yaml` — status remains `in_progress`. `modules:` extended with `drive/loop.ts` and `agents/loader.ts`.

### Architectural decision (transport deferred to v0.3.0)

- The two host adapters still return mock results. Real Claude Code subagent dispatch and real MCP roundtrips need cladding to bridge its single-shot CLI model with the host's long-running session — and the cleanest bridge is an MCP server mode (a new `clad serve` verb) that any MCP-aware host can connect to. That mode lands in v0.3.0; the v0.2.0 mock bodies are deliberate, not "not finished yet."
- The full architectural reasoning, the trade-off table, and the rejected alternatives (direct SDK call, slash-command output) live in `docs/multi-provider-roadmap.md` under "Transport architectural decision."
- `spec/features/F-049.yaml` gains AC-092 ("ship v0.2.0 with mock host adapter bodies and defer the real transport to v0.3.0") so the spec is honest about what shipped.
- No new dependency added; the loader reads `yaml` (already a transitive dep) for persona frontmatter.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-19 — Bundled CLI install path

The `clad` CLI now ships as a single esbuild bundle (`dist/clad.js`) so end-user installation is a one-liner with no runtime dev-dependency fetch. Behaviour is unchanged — every verb, every stage, every detector produces the same output as in v0.1.5.

### Added

- `scripts/build.mjs` — esbuild build script that emits `dist/clad.js` (876 KB, ESM, Node ≥ 20). Inlines `spec/schema.json` and copies it next to the bundle so `spec/validate.ts` keeps reading it via the same `readFileSync(join(__dirname, 'schema.json'))` path. Banner sets up a `createRequire` shim for the CommonJS dependencies that get bundled (e.g. `commander`).
- `package.json scripts.build` — runs `node scripts/build.mjs`.
- `package.json scripts.prepare` — auto-builds `dist/clad.js` on `npm install` when the bundle is missing and esbuild is present, so contributors and CI don't have to remember the build step.
- README + README.ko Install section — `npm install -g cladding` + `clad init` for end users; cross-tool note for Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI / Cursor / Cline / Continue.

### Changed

- `bin/clad` — now imports `dist/clad.js` directly when present (no `tsx` spawn, no `npx` fetch). Falls back to `tsx cli/clad.ts` when the bundle is absent so the dev loop keeps working without a manual rebuild after every source edit.
- `package.json files` — replaces source-tree paths with `dist/` (the bundle is the published artifact). Keeps `agents/`, `commands/`, `conformance/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `AGENTS.md`, and the standard root markdown.
- `stages/*.ts` (13 files) — the `isCliEntry` guard now also checks `globalThis.__CLADDING_BUNDLED` so the bundled build doesn't auto-fire every stage at startup. The dev path (`tsx stages/<name>.ts` / `npm run stage:<name>`) is unchanged because the flag is only set inside the bundle.
- `AGENTS.md` §2 Setup — separates the end-user install from the contributor install.

### Notes

- `dist/` is gitignored (build artifact, regenerated on every install / publish).
- `npm publish` itself stays deferred per maintainer's release policy — `prepublishOnly` is not yet wired (the `prepare` hook covers the install case; publish-time build will be added at the same time as the first `npm publish`).
- The `npm install -g github:qwerfunch/cladding` path also works: `prepare` runs after the clone and produces `dist/clad.js` (requires `--include=dev` so esbuild is available, which `prepare` would otherwise miss).
- `conformance/` is no longer listed in `package.json files` — it is a contributor self-audit tool that depends on the dev toolchain (`tsc` / `eslint` / `madge` / `secretlint` / `vitest`), none of which the end-user install ships. The L1–L4 conformance claim travels through release notes instead; external implementers verify against the upstream `ironclad-spec` fixtures, not against this runner.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-19 — Email hotfix

Security patch. No code change.

### Security

- Replaced a previously-published personal work email with the maintainer's public OSS email (`qwerfunch@gmail.com`) in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (enforcement contact), `SECURITY.md` (private vulnerability reporting), and the v0.1.1 entry of this CHANGELOG. The work address should not have been published; this patch closes future exposure surfaces.

### Notes

- Git history retains the original text in earlier commits. History rewrite is intentionally out of scope — force-pushing would break the v0.1.1 / v0.1.2 / v0.1.3 / v0.1.4 tag integrity, and the value is already in any third-party clone. Long-term containment lives at the mail-system layer (incoming mail to the old address can be blocked or forwarded — maintainer's action, outside this repo).
- The GitHub Release notes for v0.1.1 are regenerated at v0.1.5 release time so the UI also reflects the new contact.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-19 — Intent router precision + multilingual extensibility

`router/intent.ts` rewritten with high-precision, language-tagged patterns. The router still does not call an LLM (per `ironclad-design/03-ux-routing.md` P-11) — the precision change is in *which* prompts land on which verb, not in *how* they are classified.

### Changed

- **Planning intents route to `unknown`, not `drive`.** Previously `"기획 세워줘"`, `"plan it"`, `"planning"`, `"roadmap"`, `"로드맵"` all matched the `drive` rule. They now return `unknown`. Rationale: `drive` means *executing an already-defined plan as a feature group* (one scenario or several features); *making* a plan is librarian-territory and belongs to the host AI tool's natural-language layer, not a fixed CLI verb.
- **Drive rule expanded with execution-shaped keywords.** Added `execute`, `orchestrate`, `kick off` (English) and `실행해`, `진행해`, `돌려줘`, `끌고` (Korean). `drive`, `드라이브` retained.
- **Pattern structure is now language-tagged.** `Rule.patterns: Record<Lang, RegExp[]>` instead of a flat array, so future contributors can add `ja` / `zh` / `es` / others without disturbing existing rules. Each language gets its own test file (`tests/router/intent.<lang>.test.ts`) on contribution.
- **`unknown` semantics documented.** `commands/clad.md` and `AGENTS.md` §6 now state explicitly that `unknown` is not an error — it is the deliberate hand-off to the host AI tool's natural-language layer.

### Added

- `tests/router/intent.test.ts` expanded from 8 to 22 cases: 12 clear-intent (Korean + English × 5 verbs + boundary), 8 ambiguous-or-out-of-vocab returning `unknown`, 2 rule-order invariants.

### Notes

- Patch per `GOVERNANCE.md` §2. No new verb; the five Iron Core verbs (`init` / `work` / `drive` / `sync` / `check`) are unchanged.
- The `unknown` route is the deterministic side of cladding's "host-bound default" policy (F-049 / v0.1.2): cladding's own router stays LLM-free, and the host (Claude Code · OpenAI Codex · Google Gemini CLI · …) handles ambiguous prompts via its existing natural-language layer.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-19 — AGENTS.md cross-tool entry point + code-style SSoT

Doc-only patch that exposes Cladding's host-bound + no-API-key policy to the 25+ AI coding tools that read the [agents.md](https://agents.md/) standard — OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Cline, Aider, Continue, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, JetBrains Junie, Windsurf, and others. Claude Code reads the same file; no separate `CLAUDE.md` ships.

### Added

- `AGENTS.md` (root, plain markdown, no frontmatter) — nine sections: project · setup · verify · code & comment style · PR policy · agent personas · multi-host policy · Soft Shell rule · where to look. Light entry pointer; deeper content lives in `docs/`.
- `docs/code-style.md` — single source of truth for code style and comment policy across Cladding. Google Style Guides applied to every language the polyglot toolchain supports (TS · JS · Python · Java · Go · Shell · C++ · Objective-C). For languages without an official Google guide (Rust · PHP · Ruby · Elixir · .NET / C#), pin the most-widely-adopted community style (`rustfmt` · PSR-12 · `mix format` · Microsoft C# conventions). Six explicit comment principles: Why > What · full TSDoc/JSDoc field set · spec linkage (`@see` to feature shards and `ironclad-design/`) · invariant / precondition / assumption when non-obvious · self-documenting code first · forbidden list (TODO, "임시", date-bound, stale-on-edit).

### Changed

- `GOVERNANCE.md` §4.4 footer — points contributors at `docs/code-style.md` for code style and comment policy.
- `agents/specialists.md` Code policy section — replaced the inline TS-only style line with a pointer to `docs/code-style.md`; kept the Cladding-specific "Error as Data" addition.
- `README.md` + `README.ko.md` — one-line pointer to `AGENTS.md` for AI tools.

### Notes

- Patch per `GOVERNANCE.md` §2: docs only, no spec change, no behaviour change.
- `CLAUDE.md` is intentionally not shipped — Cladding is a CLI/library, not a Claude Code plugin scaffold; `AGENTS.md` is the single agent entry point.
- The comment policy applies to new code from this release on. Existing comments are not retro-rewritten; they migrate naturally as the surrounding code is touched.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-19 — Soft Shell formatter + F-049 spec generic for multi-provider

Answers two user-facing questions in one patch:

- **Q1**: how much of `ironclad-design/03-ux-routing.md` does cladding actually apply? — raised P-02 / P-05 / P-07 / P-12 from "not yet" to "partial" by introducing a Soft Shell formatter and making business-language output the CLI default.
- **Q2**: can cladding extend to GPT / Gemini and other hosts? — rewrote F-049 spec ACs to describe "agent dispatch (host or sdk)" instead of "Anthropic SDK"; encoded that **host adapters require no API key** (cladding already runs this way under Claude Code's subscription) and SDK adapters are opt-in.

No CLI behaviour regression: every previous output is still available behind `--internal` (`check`, `panel`) or `--json` (`drive`).

### Added

- `ui/softShell.ts` — single conversion layer with `featureLabel(featureId, spec)`, `haltMessage(haltReason, spec)`, `gateLabel(stageId)`. Internal ids translate to business titles for user output; the audit log keeps the raw ids.
- `tests/ui/softShell.test.ts` — 8 cases covering happy path, fallback when title is empty, fallback when feature is missing, all 10 halt classes, feature-id rewriting in halt detail, gate-label translation.
- `docs/ux-routing-coverage.md` — honest tally of the 12 prescriptions from `03-ux-routing.md` with cladding's applied/partial/not-yet state and code anchors. Maintained in lockstep with the underlying behaviour.
- `docs/multi-provider-roadmap.md` — host vs sdk two-mode model, default selection rules, adapter contract sketch, adapter matrix (`claude-code` · `generic-mcp` · `anthropic` · `openai` · `gemini`), how-to-add-a-new-adapter guide.
- F-049 acceptance criteria AC-089 (adapter selection), AC-090 (parity), AC-091 (host adapters require no API key).

### Changed

- `ui/panel.ts` — default `renderPanel(spec)` shows feature titles; pass `{internal: true}` for the legacy `F-NNN` view.
- `cli/clad.ts` — `clad check` shows stage names (`Type` / `Drift` / `UAT`) by default and codes (`stage_1.1` …) under `--internal`. `clad drive` emits a plain `haltMessage` line and a `Touched: …` list by default; the prior JSON dump moves behind `--json`. `clad panel` accepts `--internal`.
- `commands/clad.md` — added an "Output language policy" section documenting the default vs `--internal` / `--json` views.
- `agents/*.md` (5 files) — appended a "User-facing language (Soft Shell)" guideline to every persona; added a `capabilities: [...]` frontmatter line alongside the existing Claude Code `tools:` field so non-Claude-Code hosts can map the persona to their own capability enum.
- `spec/features/F-049.yaml` — rewrote AC-085 and AC-088 to use "agent dispatch (host or sdk)" via the generic `invokeAgent` interface instead of naming the Anthropic SDK directly; new title is "Cladding drive — agent dispatch & runtime orchestration (host or sdk)".

### Notes

- This is a `0.1.x` patch per `GOVERNANCE.md` §2: doc + spec + a formatter, no new stage / detector / verb / persona.
- The actual `adapters/{host,sdk}/*` implementation lands in v0.2.0 stage 1 (host adapters, cost zero) and stage 2 (sdk adapters, opt-in).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-19 — Contributor on-ramp

A docs-only patch that turns Cladding from "the maintainer's project that happens to be public" into a project an outside contributor can actually open a first PR against without DM-ing the maintainer. No behavior change in the CLI, no detector logic change.

### Added

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — fast-path entry point that points at `GOVERNANCE.md` §4 as the canonical contract and gives a 6-step new-contributor checklist.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) verbatim, with `qwerfunch@gmail.com` as the enforcement contact.
- `SECURITY.md` — private vulnerability-reporting channel, with anti-self-cert-bypass attempts classed as the highest-priority report.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — transcribes the `GOVERNANCE.md` §4.3 PR contract as a checkbox list, plus a SemVer scope picker.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` — captures `clad --version`, Node version, OS, active toolchain languages, and the Ironclad spec pin so polyglot reports are reproducible.
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` — proposes versioning scope (patch/minor/major) and self-checks against `GOVERNANCE.md` §4.1 / §4.2.
- `stages/detectors/README.md` — full 19-detector catalog table (axis · default severity · status policy · source file) plus a "when you add a new detector" contract. Names `UNTESTED_AC` and `MISSING_TESTS` as the two intentionally status-aware detectors and the other 17 as status-blind.

### Changed

- `GOVERNANCE.md` §4 — added subsection 4.4 "First PR walkthrough" with a 5-step clone-to-PR path. Points readers at `CONTRIBUTING.md` for style and at `stages/detectors/README.md` for detector conventions.

### Notes

- This is a `0.1.x` patch per the `GOVERNANCE.md` §2 policy (doc + tooling, no observable CLI behavior change).
- v0.2.0 remains the next minor release; its headline epic is F-049 (drive's LLM dispatch + 5-agent runtime).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-18 — Ironclad L4 conformant

First public release. Cladding ships every capability `ironclad-design/` planned, in *minimum-viable* form, with **iron-law L4** declared end-to-end on its own codebase.

### Added — Iron Law stages (13/13)

- `stage_1.3` Drift — plug-in registry + aggregator (19 detectors wired)
- `stage_1.4` Commit — language-agnostic `git status --porcelain`
- `stage_1.5` Arch — toolchain chain (TS→madge · Python→lint-imports)

### Added — SSoT (spec.yaml)

- v0.1 schema (jsonschema draft-07) with EARS-structured acceptance criteria
- Loader auto-detects unsharded vs sharded layout (`spec/features/*.yaml`, `spec/scenarios/*.yaml`, `spec/architecture.yaml`)
- Cladding's own self-spec — 43 features, 69 acceptance criteria, 2 scenarios

### Added — HITL infrastructure

- `hitl/identity.ts` — `EvidenceAuthor` enum (`human` | `llm` | `tool`)
- `hitl/audit.ts` — append-only JSONL audit log at `.cladding/audit.log.jsonl`
- `hitl/anti-self-cert.ts` — guard refuses to clear an AC backed only by tool/LLM evidence

### Added — EARS syntactic validator

- 5 patterns (ubiquitous · event · state · optional · unwanted) with trigger-keyword check
- Folded into AC_DRIFT detector for drift-stage reporting

### Added — Multi-agent orchestrator

- 5 personas (`orchestrator` · `librarian` · `reviewer` · `observability` · `specialists`) as Claude Code subagents
- 5 invocation principles encoded in `agents/orchestrator.md`

### Added — UX / CLI

- `clad` binary (commander-based)
- 5 Iron Core verbs (`init` · `work` · `drive` · `sync` · `check`)
- `clad init` — workspace scaffolder. One command creates `spec.yaml` seed, `.cladding/` runtime dir, and appends `.cladding/` to `.gitignore`. Auto-detects language. Idempotent; `--force` overwrites the seed.
- `clad panel` — feature × stage Integrity Panel
- `clad route <prompt>` — natural-language Intent Router (Korean + English)
- Pulse UI — `tail -f`-friendly status lines

### Added — Token optimizer

- `pruneToFeature(spec, id)` — focus feature + transitive deps
- `suppressPreamble(prompt)` — strip persona boilerplate
- `headTail(text, N, M)` — log shrinkage with elision marker
- `clad benchmark <feature>` — naive vs optimized token comparison

### Added — Conformance suite

- L1 fixtures (12) per `ironclad/conformance/level-1.md`
- L2 fixtures (4) — Unit + Cov × pass/fail
- L3 fixtures (6) — Smoke + Perf + Visual × pass/fail
- L4 fixtures (4) — Audit + UAT × pass/fail
- 26/26 fixtures match expected signal → `iron-law: L4`

### Added — Observability

- `events/log.ts` — append-only lifecycle events at `.cladding/events.log.jsonl`
- `clad benchmark` measured **87.9% token reduction** on F-008

### Added — Polyglot toolchain

- 9 languages: typescript · python · rust · go · java · php · ruby · elixir · dotnet
- Manifest-priority chain; unknown languages return `skipped` (exitCode 2), never false failure

### Added — Spec sharding

- `spec/load.ts` heuristic: master features inline → unsharded · empty master + `spec/features/` dir → sharded merge
- Architecture: master inline OR `spec/architecture.yaml`
- 4 unit tests cover both layouts + inline-wins precedence
- **Cladding's own spec migrated to sharded layout (L21.8)** — 47 features × 1 yaml file each, 2 scenarios × 1 file, 1 architecture file. Master `spec.yaml` shrinks to metadata only. `scripts/shard-spec.ts` ships the one-shot migration any project can reuse when its spec grows past one-file readability.

### Added — Repository hygiene

- `.secretlintignore` excludes `conformance/**` (synthetic secret-shaped strings live there)
- 44 vitest tests (parser, validator, EARS, toolchain, drift registry, anti-self-cert, prune, intent router)

### Conformance

- iron-law: **L4** declared on 2026-05-18 (`conformance/runner.ts` reports 26/26 matched)
- detectors: **19/19**
- stages: **13/13**
- ears: **syntactic**

### Known limitations

- `clad drive` ships as a **deterministic floor** (per [F-048](spec/features/F-048.yaml) AC-083): it iterates ready features in dependency order, materialises module stubs, and runs L1 gates (`type` · `lint` · `arch`). It does **not** invoke an LLM and does **not** dispatch the five agent personas. Real LLM-coordinated authoring lands in v0.2 via [F-049](spec/features/F-049.yaml). The two reserved halt classes `HUMAN_REQUIRED` and `LLM_UNAVAILABLE` (`drive/halt.ts`) are wiring for that work.
- The Iron Law L4 conformance claim above was earned by **human signoff on Cladding's own audit log**. It demonstrates that the L4 *machinery* (anti-self-cert guard, UAT human-pass requirement, reviewer-vs-author identity separation) is correct end-to-end. It does **not** demonstrate that machinery catching an LLM-authored implementation in flight — that stronger qualitative claim arrives with v0.2 + F-049.
- The five agent personas under `agents/*.md` ship as Claude Code subagent definitions and a routing contract. They are **not yet wired** to a runtime orchestrator; `drive/loop.ts` does not call them.
