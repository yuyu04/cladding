// Cladding · UI · Soft Shell formatter
//
// Per `ironclad-design/03-ux-routing.md` §1.2-1.3 (Iron Core vs Soft
// Shell boundary), internal identifiers (`F-NNN`, `AC-NNN`, stage IDs,
// halt-class enum values) must not leak into user-facing output by
// default. The audit log retains them verbatim for replay and forensic
// use; the user surface sees business language.
//
// This module is the single conversion layer. Anywhere the CLI prints
// to a user, route the value through one of these functions first.
// Anywhere the audit log records evidence, keep the internal id raw.
