// Cladding · drift detector · HOLLOW_GOVERNANCE
//
// Closes the design-tier "two-layer Vacuous Green" the A/B evaluation exposed:
// `clad init` SEEDS spec/capabilities.yaml (`capabilities: []`) and
// spec/architecture.yaml (`layers: []`) as empty templates. Those empty seeds
// (1) satisfy ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE's existence-only check, and (2) make
// CAPABILITIES_FEATURE_MAPPING / ARCHITECTURE_FROM_SPEC early-return on empty
// content — so a 23-feature project ships with an entirely empty design SSoT and
// the strict gate stays GREEN. (Verified: both A/B builds, 23 and 6 features,
// 0 blocking findings.)
//
// This detector adds the missing SCALE-AWARE, CONTENT-aware signal: once a
// project has grown past a feature threshold, a PRESENT-but-EMPTY design
// artifact is drift, not a legitimately-small project. It is the design-tier
// sibling of PLANNED_BACKLOG — but deliberately STATUS-BLIND: it counts ALL
// features, because PLANNED_BACKLOG counts only planned/in_progress and would
// no-op on the all-`done` builds the gap actually appeared in.
//
// DIVISION OF LABOUR with ABSENCE_OF_GOVERNANCE: ABSENCE owns EXISTENCE (file
// missing → warn); HOLLOW_GOVERNANCE owns PRESENT-but-EMPTY content. A missing
// file is NOT double-reported here — we flag only a file that exists yet carries
// no design content.
//
// warn, not error: a small/early project legitimately defers its design docs, so
// the signal rides the existing warn/strict dial — advisory locally, BLOCKING
// under --strict at push/CI. The feature threshold is a hardcoded constant.
