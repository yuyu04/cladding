// Cladding · drift detector · DELIVERABLE_INTEGRITY
//
// Companion to stage_2.4 (DELIVERABLE_SMOKE). Pure, deterministic, zero-side-effect
// — it NEVER executes anything (that is the stage's job). Two checks, done-only:
//   - project.deliverable.path declared but ABSENT on disk → error (blocking): a
//     project that has shipped a `done` feature must have its declared entry present.
//   - done features ship modules[] but NO project.deliverable is declared → warn,
//     with info-level grace only for explicitly marked onboarding seeds before
//     the shared eight-feature maturity boundary:
//     the gate cannot smoke-test the shipped entry, so a broken entry could ship
//     green (the Mini-Lang S5 failure). The graduated signal keeps early
//     domain/library slices completable while ensuring a grown project's omitted
//     smoke decision remains auditable and strict-gate actionable.
//
// BOUNDARY: presence/absence only. Whether the entry RUNS is stage_2.4; whether it
// is CORRECT per spec is the impl-blind oracle (stage_2.3).
