// Cladding · drift detector · PROJECT_CONTEXT_DRIFT
//
// The deferred detector from docs/ssot-model.md (Q-audit). `docs/project-context.md`
// is the Tier-B "why does this exist" narrative, but it has the weakest firing path:
// written once at onboarding, then orphaned — nothing escalates a project-context
// that was never filled in. Both A/B builds left it as the deterministic init
// fallback (the "_Refine by hand or re-run with LLM available._" stub) over 20+
// features, and the gate stayed GREEN.
//
// This detector flags a GROWN project whose project-context.md is still a verbatim
// init TEMPLATE — detected by the placeholder sentinels the two seed templates
// carry (a refined doc replaces them with real prose). Scale-gated: a small/early
// project may legitimately leave it stubbed. warn, not error: it rides the
// warn/strict dial — advisory locally, blocking under --strict.
