// is non-blocking. That leniency is correct for fresh projects and partial
// toolchains, but it converts "done = verified" into a silent pass whenever
// the missing tool happens to be the one the spec RELIES on. Pre-0.6 only
// the Unit stage had a guard; this module generalizes it: under --strict, a
// skipped stage the spec DEMANDS is a fail, appended as its own entry so the
// user sees exactly which demand went unmet.
//
// Demand-gated, never blanket — no demand ⇒ skip stays green. This is the
// false-RED defense that ships BEFORE the 0.6 enforcement hooks lean on it.
