// Cladding · stages · shared test-run cache — run-scoped, gate-seam-lifetimed
//
// WHY (issue #215). One `clad check --tier=pre-push` can run the SAME suite
// TWICE: stage_2.1 (unit) spawns the test runner and stage_2.2 (coverage) spawns
// it again under coverage. On large Vitest and pytest suites that is the single
// biggest chunk of gate wall-clock. This module lets the unit stage spawn the
// COVERAGE command ONCE — augmented with the vacuous-test guard's dual json
// reporter when applicable — and publish that one process so the coverage stage folds the cached
// exit signal instead of re-spawning vitest.
//
// GUARD-COMPATIBLE (the reason PR #216 was rejected). #216 deduped by having the
// unit stage `return {pass:true}` off the shared coverage run, which silently
// disabled the vacuous-test guard (F-b81d203e) on the reuse path. Here the shared
// run ALWAYS carries `--reporter=json --outputFile=<tmp>` so the guard still has
// its per-test input, and unit.ts runs `vacuousDoneFindings` against that json
// BEFORE it may return a passing unit result (AC-6b2d81f7). This module owns only
// the run + its temp-json lifetime; the guard decision stays in unit.ts.
//
// LIFETIME (mirrors detector-result-cache.ts / spec/load.ts). The session is
// primed and cleared ONLY at the gate-run seam — cli/clad.ts runCheckStages —
// and the caller MUST clear in a `finally`. The stage loop is synchronous, so a
// session primed around it and cleared in finally cannot serve a stale run
// mid-gate. The MCP serve layer runs gates via a `bin/clad` subprocess, so the
// session lives entirely inside one process run; tests drive these functions
// in-process, so the finally-clear discipline is mandatory — a leaked session
// would hand one test's run (and its already-unlinked temp json) to the next.
