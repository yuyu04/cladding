// Cladding · `clad update` — post-upgrade project reconciliation.
//
// WHY this exists: an npm / marketplace upgrade replaces the ENGINE — the global
// `clad` binary plus its detectors, schema, and personas. Those reach the user
// the moment they upgrade (the binary is read live; the host wiring is a symlink
// that follows it). But three things do NOT auto-follow an upgrade:
//   1. host wiring — a symlink can need re-pointing, or a new version adds a
//      channel/skill the old `clad setup` never wired;
//   2. the spec.yaml `inventory:` snapshot — a frozen count of project scale;
//   3. the cladding-managed CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md section — host guidance the AI
//      reads each session, materialized into the user's repo at init time.
// Re-running `clad setup` + `clad sync` + `clad init` by hand is the documented
// routine; this folds the SAFE parts into one idempotent command so an upgrade
// is two lines: `npm update -g cladding`, then `clad update`.
//
// DESIGN — safe-auto, data-report (the same split the whole update model uses):
//   * Mechanical, idempotent steps (re-wire, inventory, managed-section refresh)
//     run automatically. The managed-section refresh is staleness-based (never
//     `--force`, never an LLM call — see host-instructions.ts), so a user's own
//     prose is preserved and a fresh section is left untouched.
//   * The user's OWN data — their spec — is never auto-edited here. `clad update`
//     does NOT run the gate as a gate; the caller (runUpdateCommand) runs the
//     now-stricter detectors in REPORT mode so the command SHOWS what bar the
//     upgrade raised (it can't hide that — anti-Vacuous-Green) without blocking
//     or rewriting the spec. Reconciling findings stays the user's call.
//   * Idempotent: a second run with nothing stale is a clean no-op.
