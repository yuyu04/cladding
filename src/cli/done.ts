// Cladding · `clad done <featureId>` — the gated done-transition.
//
// WHY this exists: `status: done` is normally just the host AI writing YAML, so
// a feature can be declared "done" while its code does not typecheck or its
// tests are missing. The A/B run observed exactly this — a host marked 23
// features done while `clad check --tier=pre-push --strict` was RED (Type / Lint
// / Coverage failing). `done` claimed more than it had earned.
//
// `clad done` makes the transition EARN itself: flip the shard to done, run the
// pre-push strict gate, and KEEP done only if that gate is GREEN — otherwise
// revert. It is the floor that keeps `done` honest even outside the per-feature
// driver loop (a host that hand-writes `status: done` bypasses this verb, but
// the same gate at push/CI then fails on that feature's red stages).
//
// FLIP-THEN-GATE ORDER is deliberate: the done-aware detectors UNTESTED_AC and
// MISSING_TESTS skip features that are not yet `done`, so gating BEFORE the flip
// would green-light a feature that has no tests. We flip first so the gate
// evaluates the feature as done, then revert if it does not hold.
