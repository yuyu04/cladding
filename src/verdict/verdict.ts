// Cladding · verdict reducer (F-2e28cc72, load-bearing)
//
// One poll → one decision. A host loop calls `clad verdict` each turn and reads
// ONE of {DONE, ITERATE, ESCALATE, BLOCKED, BOOTSTRAP} instead of re-deriving
// the disposition→decision mapping over the raw gate dump. This module is the
// PURE reducer: it takes an already-computed gate outcome + the spec and returns
// the verdict. No IO, no spawn, no process.exit — unit-testable in isolation
// (the GATE 1 proof), and it imports NOTHING from src/cli/* or src/serve/*
// (topology: cli → serve → verdict). It may read the disposition spine
// (src/stages/*) and the spec types (src/spec/*).
//
// The DONE guarantee is structural, not cosmetic: DONE requires a GREEN gate AND
// every non-archived feature status:done AND at least one non-liveness
// behavioral proof (a real unit/oracle/smoke pass). A gate that is green only
// because its behavioral stages were skip/na/liveness returns ITERATE — never
// the confident-garbage "finished" signal the gate exists to prevent.
